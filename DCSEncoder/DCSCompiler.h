// DCS Compiler
//
// This class is a utility for creating new DCS ROMs.  It lets you
// construct and manipulate an in-memory representation of the contents 
// of a ROM set, including the prototype ADSP-2015 program, audio track
// programs, audio streams, and deferred-indirect table structures, and
// it can then compile the in-memory representation into a set of ROM
// images, packaged in the PinMame .zip format.
// 
// This class doesn't provide a way to create new ADSP-2105 programming
// code for the ROM control program.  Instead, you provide an existing
// DCS ROM set, from any DCS title that used the same version of the
// audio boards that you intend to target, as the source of the program
// code.  The ROM builder reads the provided ROM and transfers the main
// program code to the new ROM set.  In principle, you could create your
// own ADSP-2105 program using a separate set of development tools for
// that processor, as long as your program followed the same conventions
// as the original DCS programs in terms of the ROM data format.
// 
// In addition to trasnferring the ADSP-2105 control program from an
// existing ROM set, the DCS Compiler class can also transfer the entire
// data contents of an existing ROM set, to use as the basis of the new
// ROM.  This lets you "patch" an existing ROM - replacing some of the
// sound clips while keeping others, for example.
// 
// The generated ROM set replicates the layout of the original DCS ROMs,
// so it's suitable for use with PinMame or for burning into physical
// PROM chips for installation in a physical DCS board.

	// Load the prototype ROM set.  This is the first step in compiling a
	// new ROM, and it should be completed before creating any new objects
	// (tracks, streams, etc) for the new ROM set.  The prototype ROM
	// provides the ADSP-2105 program that's transferred to the new ROM as
	// its main control program, so it determines the target hardware type
	// that the new ROM set will run on.
	// 
	// If 'patchMode' is true, all of the data from the prototype ROM will
	// be loaded along with the control program - track programs, audio
	// streams, etc.  This lets the old ROM serve as the starting point for
	// the new ROM.  The caller can then create new objects and replace
	// existing ones before generating the new ROM set, to create a
	// modified version of the original ROM.  This makes it possible to
	// make isolated changes in an existing game's ROM, such as replacing
	// audio clips or modifying track program steps.
	//
	// The prototype ROM must satisfy two rules.  First, it must match the
	// target hardware type - the platform that the new ROM will run on.
	// There are only two hardware types: the original DCS audio boards,
	// used in machines from 1993 to 1995, and the DCS-95 audio/video boards,
	// used from 1995 to 1998.  The ADSP-2105 control software for the two
	// boards is mutually incompatible, so the new ROM set will only run on
	// the same hardware that the prototype ROM set runs on.  Second, the
	// prototype ROM must NOT be from any of the first three DCS games from
	// 1993 (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Indiana Jones: The Pinball
	// Adventure, Judge Dredd).  The software for those games used a
	// different audio stream format from the later software, and this
	// project can only encode streams for the later format.

	// Generate the new ROM set.  This creates the ROM images based on
	// the current in-memory data structures, and writes them to the
	// specified .zip file.  All of the non-DCS files from the prototype
	// ROM set are copied into the new .zip file, so that the result can
	// be used as a replacement for the original ROM set in PinMame or
	// other programs that take PinMame ROM sets.
	// 
	// When patching a ROM set that you plan to use with PinMame, set
	// romSize to ROMSIZE_SAME_AS_PROTO and romPrefix to "*".
	//
	// 'romSize' specifies the size of the individual ROM chips, in
	// bytes.  To generate ROM images compatible with physical DCS
	// boards, ROMs must be either 512K or 1M, since the boards are
	// wired to accept only those two sizes.  The two sizes can be
	// freely mixed within a game.
	// 
	// You can also pass the magic value ROMSIZE_SAME_AS_PROTO for
	// romSize, which sets the size of each chip individually to the
	// size of the corresponding chip in the prototype ROM set.  This
	// is useful primarily if you plan to use a patched ROM set with
	// PinMame, because PinMame has a hard-coded list of known ROMs,
	// including the size of each chip, and it will only load the size
	// hard-coded into its list.
	// 
	// 'romPrefix' is a string that's used as a prefix for the ROM names
	// in the generated zip file.  The ROm files are named using the
	// pattern
	// 
	//    <prefix><u><n>.rom
	//
	// where <u> is the letter 'u' for a DCS-93 hardware target or 's'
	// for DCS_95 hardware, and <n> is the ROM chip number, 2-9.  So if
	// the prefix is "mm_", the ROM names would look like "mm_s2.rom".
	// 
	// If 'romPrefix' is "*", the generator will reuse the same names
	// for the corresponding chips from the prototype ROM.  This is
	// useful for patching a ROM set for use with PinMame, because
	// PinMame's hard-coded list of known ROMs includes the filenames
	// of the zip entries.
	//
	// If romList is non-null, it's cleared and populated with entries
	// describing the newly created ROMs on success.  This is purely
	// for information purposes, to tell the caller what's in the new
