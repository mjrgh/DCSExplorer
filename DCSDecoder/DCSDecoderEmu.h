// DCS Decoder implementation using interpreted ADSP-2105 machine code
//
// This implements the DCSDecoder interface using Aaron Giles's ADSP-2100
// emulator to run the original machine code found in the DCS ROMs.  This
// is the way that PinMame has always implemented DCS emulation.  
// 
// The most important goal of the DCSDecoder class is to provide a full
// native implementation of the decoder, which is implemented separately.
// Native means no emulation - a full C++ translation of the decoder.
// So why are we talking about emulation now???  Because we're providing
// the emulator implementation *in addition to* the native decoder.  The
// emualtor is a reference point to compare the native deocder against
// to determine if it's working correctly.  Running the original ROM code
// in emulation is as close as we can get to a reference standard, short 
// of running the original ROM code on the original hardware.  Of course,
// the emulator isn't guaranteed to be a perfect replica, since it could
// have errors in the ADSP-2105 CPU emulator, or in our virtualization
// of the peripheral hardware environment, that cause the emulator to
// behave differently from the original boards.  But at least we're
// reasonably assured that the same sequence of ADSP-2105 instructions
// is being executed.
//
// Note that this class can only be instantiated once at a time, because
// the ADSP-2105 emulator that it's based on is defined using static
// state variables.  This limitation could in principle be lifted by
// saving and restoring the emulator's entire state on each call (this
// is what PinMame does with many of its CPU emulators, most of which
// also use statics to maintain their state), but that would incur some
// overhead, and I don't see any compelling reason anyone would want to
// instantiate more than one emulator-based decoder at a time anyway.
