// DCS Decoder - base class for DCS audio player implementations
//
// This class defines the interface to C++ implementations of an
// audio player for DCS ROMs, replicating the functionality of the
// embedded software in the DCS audio boards installed in Williams/
// Bally/Midway pinball machines manufactured in the 1990s.  The
// interface is designed to allow for multiple implementations, so
// that client programs can be written independently of the concrete
// implementation used.  The main implementation options are running
// the original ADSP-2105 ROM code in emulation, and using a fully
// native, portable C++ re-implementation of the decoder.
// 
// This class is designed to be easily embedded in any host program,
// and can be used for real-time playback, or for streaming or capturing
// the decoded audio.  The audio stream is decoded into signed 16-bit
// PCM samples, suitable for direct playback through PC sound cards or
// even directly through a hardware DAC.  The decoded samples use the
// fixed DCS sample rate of 31250 samples per second.
// 
// Here's how to use this class in a client program:
// 
// - Define a concrete subclass of DCSDecoder::Host.  This lets
//   the host receive notifications of certain events in the
//   decoder that an attached WPC board would need to know about.
//   If you don't need any notifications, you can use MinHost
//   rather than defining your own custom subclass.
// 
// - If you're using the decoder with a WPC emulator, implement
//   the BootTimerControl() override in your host interface to
//   coordinate timing with the WPC subsystem via your emulator's
//   timing system.
// 
// - Create an instance of the desired concrete subclass.  
//   Choose DCSDecoderNative for the universal native version, or 
//   DCSDecoderEmulated for the ADSP-2105 emulator version.  The 
//   native version is much faster, so it's the one to use in most
//   situations.  The emulated version is primarily meant to serve 
//   as a reference point to verify that the native version yields
//   the same output as the original ADSP-2105 code.
// 
// - Load the ROM files:
// 
//   - If you're working with a ROM image zip file formatted
//     for use with PinMame, you can load it with one call to
//     LoadROMFromZipFile().
// 
//   - If you're working with your own data source for the
//     ROMs, load the images into memory using whatever means
//     you wish.  Each individual ROM image must simply be
//     loaded into a contiguous memory block.  Call AddROM()
//     for each ROM image to add it to the decoder's internal
//     list.  Then make one call to CheckROMs() to complete
//     the internal ROM setup based on the loaded data.
// 
// - Call HardBootDecoder()
// 
// - If you want to skip the startup "Bong", call
//   SoftBootDecoder()
//
// - If you're going to be playing back audio in real time, 
//   start your hardware sound player system.
// 
// - If you're using the decoder for something other than
//   playback (in other words, you won't just be calling
//   GetNextSample() in a loop), call SoftBootDecoder().  This
//   will happen automatically when doing simple decoding, but
//   you'll have to do it explicitly for other scenarios.
// 
// - Call GetNextSample() as many times as needed to fill (and
//   refill) your audio playback buffer.  For real-time playback,
//   you must monitor the hardware playback read position, and
//   refill the buffer as the hardware reader consumes samples.
//   (Remember that the decoder is single-threaded.  If your audio
//   player uses a separate thread to manage buffer refill, you
//   must ensure that it doesn't call GetNextSample() concurrently
//   with any other access to the object.)
// 
// - To send a command to the DCS decoder (for example, to start 
//   playback of a new track), call WriteDataPort().  This accepts
//   one byte at a time, as in the original hardware design, where
//   the system MPU board communicates with the sound board through
//   an 8-bit latch port.  DCS track commands are two bytes each,
//   which you can send by calling WriteDataPort() twice.  You can
//   write multiple bytes consecutively - no time delay is needed
//   between bytes.
// 
// The decoder is single-threaded.  It has no internal protection
// against concurrent access from multiple threads.  If your audio
// playback system is multi-threaded (for example, if it uses a
// background thread to refill its audio buffer), you must use your
// own means to ensure that decoder methods are never entered by
// multiple threads simultaneously.  The simplest way to do this
// is to ensure that all calls into the decoder are made from the
// same thread.  (Note that this doesn't have to be the foreground
// thread - all that matters is that it's always the *same* thread
// calling into the decoder.)  If single-threading isn't practical
// for your application, it is possible to use the decoder from
// multiple threads, as long as you implement your own mechanism
// to ensure that only one thread at a time calls into the decoder.
// For example, you could create a Windows mutex, and ensure that
// your code always acquires the mutex before calling any method
// in the decoder, and releases the mutex on return.

		// of the original DCS ROM code's hard boot process.  When
		// the DCS board is reset by an external signal (at power-on
		// or when the WPC board writes to the sound board's "control"
		// port), the original ROM software monitors the data port
		// for 250ms.  If a byte appears on the data port within
		// that time, the ROM immediately launches the main decoder
		// program.  This allows the WPC host to quickly reboot the
		// sound board at any time, to force it into a known state,
		// with no perceptible delay - the whole soft reset process
		// only takes a few milliseconds.  When the WPC wants to
		// perform a quick reset, it writes to the control port (to
		// initiate the hard reset) and then immediately writes a
		// byte to the data port to signal the soft reset.
		//
		// If nothing appears on the data port within the first
		// 250ms after a hard reset, the hard boot ROM program
		// proceeds to run its power-on self tests, which validate
		// the ROM checksums and run a read/write test on RAM.
		// If these pass, the board plays the startup "bong" and
		// soft boots into the main decoder program.
		//
		// The emulated version of the decoder doesn't perform any
		// of the power-on self-tests, as they're not particularly
		// meaningful in an emulation.  We still need to emulate
		// all of the timing behavior of the boot process, though,
		// for the sake of communicating properly with a separate WPC
		// emulator, if the host is using one.  That's what this host

	//   sequences audio playback.  The track numbers are
	//   idiosyncratic, but most of the games arrange things in
	//   groups of related tracks.  0000 is usually a "stop all"
	//   command, and the main music tracks are usually in the
	//   low 00xx range (0001 through 0020 or so).  Higher 00xx
	//   tracks are often shorter music cues and loops.  Higher
	//   numbers 01xx through 09xx are usually sound effects for

	//   preceding byte, as an error check on the transmission.)
	//   Volume 00 is complete mute; FF is the highest setting,
	//   which plays samples at the recorded reference volume.
	//   Levels in between attenuate the PCM samples on a roughly
	//   logarithmic scale.
	// 
	// 55 Ax level ~level  (where Ax is AB..B0)
	//   Set the mixing level for the given channel (AB=1, AF=6).
	//   Internally, the decoder plays back up to six audio
	//   streams simultaneously, mixing them together to form
	//   the final output stream.  Note that "channel" doesn't
	//   refer to a stereo or surround channel - DCS for pinball
	//   was purely monophonic.  Channels are just internal
	//   constructs for playing back multiple clips at once and
	//   mixing them together in the output.  This command sets
	//   the relative volume of an individual channel in the
	//   final mix.
	// 
	// 55 Bx byte ~byte  (where Bx is BA..BF)
	//   This sets another per-track property that was never
	//   implemented in the DCS pinball ROMs.  The later ROM
	//   code (From version 1.04) recognizes this command, and
	//   stores the byte value in an internal data structure
	//   associated with the channel (BA = channel 1, BB=2,
	//   etc), but the value is never used anywhere else in
	//   the program.  This must have been something planned
	//   for future implementation that never made it into any
	//   of the pinball games.
	// 
	// 55 Cx  (where Cx is C2 or C3)
	//   Query the DCS software version number.  Sends back
	//   one byte on the DCS->WPC data port.  55C2 retrieves
	//   the major version number, 55C3 gets retrieves the
	//   minor version number.  This query only exists in the
	//   DCS-95 software, and it returns 1.03, 1.04, or 1.05,
	//   depending on the game.  (Our native code implementation
	//   returns 1.06 by default, to distinguish it from the
	//   emulated versions, but the host can override that
	//   if desired.)
	// 
	// I suspect that all of the 55xx codes beyond 55AA (Set
	// Master Volume) are for debugging purposes, or were for
	// features that were planned for future games but which were
