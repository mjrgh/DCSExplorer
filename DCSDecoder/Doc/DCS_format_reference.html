<h1>DCS Audio Format Technical Reference</h1>
<img src="VolumeUI.png" class="ex">
<p>
   This is an unofficial technical reference guide to the internals of DCS audio format used
   in the classic Williams/&ZeroWidthSpace;Bally/&ZeroWidthSpace;Midway pinball machines
   of the 1990s.  DCS (initials for Digital Compression System) consists of
   a family of proprietary digital audio compression formats, along with
   a run-time system tailored to the real-time event-driven playback environment
   of an arcade game.  The DCS bit-stream formats are similar in their
   broad outlines to standard formats like MP3 and Vorbis, but only <i>similar</i>.
   They're not in any way compatible with any of the standard formats, and they're not
   based on or derived from any of them.  The DCS formats were entirely original, designed
   from the ground up, before any of today's formats even existed.
</p>
<p>
   The DCS decoders found in the 1990s pinball machines were implemented with
   dedicated circuit boards based on the Analog Devices ADSP-2105.  That was a
   specialized CPU designed just for DSP applications, so it was a good fit
   for the job at the time.  But there's nothing about DCS itself that's tied
   to that particular hardware.  DCS was an entirely software system that
   happened to run on ADSP-2105.  General-purpose CPUs have become so much
   faster since the 1990s that equivalent software can now easily be implemented
   on just about any modern processor, even including relatively low-end machines
   like a Raspberry Pi or Pico.  This reference is all about the <i>formats</i>,
   which aren't tied to the original hardware, so we don't cover the old hardware
   in any detail here.  If the hardware is your main interest, you can find
   much better information on that elsewhere on the web (see <a href="#References">References</a>),
</p>
<p>
   This reference guide describes the DCS audio encoding system in detail,
   including the procedures for encoding and decoding bit streams in
   each of the compressed audio formats.  It also covers the "track program"
   system that controls playback, and the layout of the DCS audio ROMs.
   The reference material includes the complete algorithms and data tables
   required to encode and decode DCS data streams, track programs, and
   ROMs.  It goes into enough detail that you could use it to write a
   complete DCS encoder/decoder from scratch.
</p>
<p>
   This documentation is part of my
   <a href="https://github.com/mjrgh/DCSExplorer" target="_blank">DCS Explorer</a>
   project, which
   includes a portable C++ decoder/player that understands all of the DCS
   audio formats, and an encoder that can create new, original DCS audio ROMs,
   including new compressed digital audio streams in the DCS format.
   In the course of that project, I had to figure out
   how DCS works at a detailed level.  I've attempted to capture what
   I learned here, for sharing and future reference.  DCS Explorer's
   C++ source code might be useful as a companion to this material, as a
   reference implementation of the algorithms described here.
</p>
<p>
   The formats covered here are limited to those implemented in the WPC-based
   pinball machines.  Williams continued to develop DCS for use in video
   games for several years after its last pinball machines, expanding it
   to include stereo and surround sound capabilities.  I only looked at
   the pinball games, though, so this reference stops at the 1998 version,
   which was still monophonic.
</p>
<p>
   I find DCS to be a fascinating bit of pinball and technology history.
   It was cutting-edge for its day, and it still looks pretty modern now,
   decades later, given its similarities to mainstream digital audio
   formats like MP3.  The designers created a new digital audio format
   from scratch at a time when the whole idea of lossy audio compression
   was just starting to make the transition from theory to practice, when few other
   examples existed.  It's all the more remarkable that this little feat of
   engineering  was all for the sake of <i>pinball</i>, of all things.
   Today, there's no serious reason for anyone to understand the format;
   the existing pinball ROMs can be played back on any PC using the PinMame
   emulator, and anyone wishing to create new audio for an old
   pinball machine would probably just replace the machine's entire
   audio system with more modern hardware that can play back MP3 files.
   I only looked into the format's internals to satisfy my curiosity.
   Perhaps this reference will do the same for a few other people who
   also wonder what's inside those audio boards, or who think it would
   be a neat trick to create a new DCS ROM after all this time.

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>
   In keeping with the "unofficial" theme, my terminology for DCS's
   internals is entirely made up.  This section defines some terms
   that I use throughout the rest of the document to refer to specific
   elements of the system.  Note that these probably aren't the "real"
   names for the elements that the original engineers used; they're
   just what made sense to me as I figured out how the system works.
</p>

<h3>Tracks and Streams</h3>
<p>
   DCS has two major object types related to audio playback:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b><a href="#TrackPrograms">Track programs</a></b>, which are miniature procedural computer
   programs, written in a custom byte-code language that DCS defines,
   that perform simple tasks related to audio playback and event
   synchronization.

   <li><b><a href="#Streams">Audio streams</a></b>, which are binary data streams containing
   compressed digital audio data, designed for simple linear playback from start to end.
</ul>

<p>
   These object types are explained in much greater detail later in
   this document.  But I wanted to mention them up-front because of
   the potential confusion about what a "track" is.  In an everyday,
   non-technical context, an audio "track" would probably be understood
   as something like a single MP3 file: a linear audio clip that you
   load into a player for playback from start to end.  DCS has
   simple linear audio clips like that as well, but I call those
   "streams", to distinguish them from the miniature procedural
   programs that I call "tracks".  The reason I call the latter
   "tracks" is that they're the operational units that you see from
   the outside world.  DCS doesn't expose the individual stream
   objects in its external command interface - that is, the
   data port interface that the main WPC board, which controls
   the mechanical part of the pinball game, communicates with
   when it wants to activate sound effects.  The WPC board
   can only access the tracks.  From an
   outside perspective, the track programs basically <i>are</i> the audio
   objects: if you want to play a particular audio cue, you tell
   DCS to play the track that plays back that cue.  That's why
   it seems more appropriate to refer to these objects as the
   tracks.  Anyone looking at DCS from the outside would think
   they actually are "tracks", in the ordinary sense
   of the word as linear audio clips.  The streams, in
   contrast, amount to an implementation detail that's invisible
   from the outside.  But we're looking at how the system works
   on the inside, and from that perspective, the streams
   become distinct entities, so I needed to given them their
   own name.
</p>

<h3>Channels</h3>
<p>
   The DCS software organizes all of its audio processing
   into "channels".  These aren't stereo channels or
   surround-sound channels, though.  The DCS-based pinball machines
   only had monophonic speaker systems, and the audio
   recordings themselves are purely in mono.  (Later versions
   of DCS used in video games did have stereo and surround
   features, but that never made it into any DCS pinball games.)
</p>
<p>
   What I call "channels" throughout this document are the
   internal data structures that keep track of the individual audio
   clips that are currently playing.  The purpose of the channels
   is that they allow the software to play back more than one clip
   at a time, to overlay multiple effects simultaneously: music
   and a voice clip and a sound effect, for example.  The sounds
   playing in the different channels are all mixed together, still
   in the digital domain, to form the final mono output signal.
   These are channels in the sense of a recording studio's
   mixing console, where the engineer combines
   separate recordings of the vocals and instruments and
   so forth into the final mix.
</p>
<p>
   Each channel is a container for two live playback objects:
   one track, and one stream.  The channel keeps track of the
   current program counter in its track and the current
   stream pointer for its stream, along with counters for
   repeat loops and delays.  Each channel also has several
   volume level adjustments to control the relative volume
   of its contribution to the mixing stage.
</p>
<p>
   The earliest version of the DCS software, used in the 1993 games,
   has four channels, numbered 0 through 3.  All of the later
   versions have six channels, numbered 0 through 5.  (The DCS-95
   software makes room in its memory structures for
   eight channels, but none of the pinball titles use more
   than six.  Perhaps the extra channels were used in video
   games released in the same time-frame, or maybe they
   were just included for future use.)
</p>
   

<h2>Datatypes and notation</h2>

<h3>Decimal and hexadecimal numbers</h3>

<p>
   We use a "$" prefix to indicate a hex number.  For example, $FF
   is the hex number that equals 255 in decimal.
   Decimal numbers are written in the ordinary way, with no
   special prefix.  When showing values that go in fixed-width fields,
   I often include leading zeros to pad out the number to its fixed width:
   $00A0 for a value that goes in a 16-bit field, for example.  An offset
   within a ROM requires 20 bits to specify, so I usually write these as
   5-hex-digit numbers, such as $04000.  Leading zeros in a
   hex number don't change its numerical value, of course; they're just
   there to emphasize the way the value is stored internally.
</p>

<h3>Byte order (Endian-ness)</h3>
<p>
   DCS is Big-Endian.
   All multi-byte integer types in the DCS software and ROM data are
   arranged in big-endian order, with the most significant byte first.
   This was undoubtedly chosen for convenience of implementation on the
   original ADSP-2105 processor platform, since that processor uses
   big-endian conventions.  It's also the convention that Williams
   used in all of their other software that I've encountered, which is a
   nice bit of consistency, especially considering that the concept of
   Endianness wasn't all that well defined in the 8-bit days.
</p>

   
<h3>Integer types</h3>
<p>
   I use the following notation to refer to various
   integer types found in the ROM data:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>BYTE: an 8-bit unsigned integer, $00 to $FF
   <li>INT8: a signed 8-bit integer, -128 to +127
   <li>INT16: a signed 16-bit integer, -32,768 to +32,767, stored in 2's complement format and big-endian byte order
   <li>UINT16: an unsigned 16-bit integer, 0 to 65,535, stored in big-endian byte order
   <li>UINT24: an unsigned 24-bit integer, 0 to 16,777,215, stored in big-endian byte order, used as a pointer to a ROM location
</ul>
<p>
   "Signed" means that the values of that type are interpreted as
   having an arithmetic sign (positive or negative).  "Unsigned" means
   that all values of the type are positive or zero, never negative.
   An unsigned N-bit integer has twice the positive range of a signed
   integer of the same bit width, but the trade-off is that it can't
   store any negative values.
</p>

<h3>C++ stdint.h types</h3>
<p>
   Some examples and descriptions of algorithms use C/C++ code, or
   C/C++-like pseudo-code.  Most of the variables there use either
   native C/C++ integer types (int, unsigned, etc) or the types
   defined in the standard C++ header file <tt>stdint.h</tt>.
   <tt>stdint.h</tt> defines a set of integer types with specific bit
   widths, which are useful in a DCS context because many of the
   calculations are bit-oriented and thus depend upon the bit-level
   representation of the value.  The <tt>stdint.h</tt> types use
   the naming convention <tt>int<i>N</i>_t</tt> for a signed N-bit
   integer (e.g., int16_t for a signed 16-bit int), and <tt>uint<i>N</i>_t</tt>
   for an unsigned N-bit integer (uint32_t is an unsigned 32-bit int).
</p>

<h3>Fixed-point numbers</h3>
<p>
   The original ADSP-2105 implementation of the decoder makes heavy
   use of something called fixed-point numbers, which are a way to
   represent fractional values (and perform arithmetic on them)
   using only integer operations.  I've <i>mostly</i>
   tried to keep this sort of ADSP-2105-specific detail out of this
   document - it shouldn't really matter how the ADSP-2105 happened
   to store a particular number, because the abstract mathematical value of the
   number is usually what's important, not the particular bit pattern
   used to store it on one particular machine.  But there are cases
   where you have to use the original fixed-point representation in
   a calculation if you want to arrive at a numerically identical result,
   because any other computer representation of the same numbers might
   result in slight differences in the output of a calculation, due
   to rounding errors when fractional values have to be rounded to
   fit the particular computer format chosen.
   The final numerical results in such cases will generally still agree
   <i>within the respective rounding errors</i> of the formats involved,
   but they won't always be numerically identical.  For testing purposes
   in particular, it's important to be able to reproduce results that
   are truly identical, so that there's no question that the new program
   is yielding the same results as the original.  So I wanted to at
   least mention the fixed-point format and describe how it works.
</p>
<p>
   The DCS ADSP-2105 code uses two forms of fixed-point numbers, known as
   0.16 and 1.15 numbers.  A 0.16 number is a 16-bit integer variable
   where all 16 bits are interpreted as following the binary point.
   The mathematical value of a 0.16 variable is the unsigned integer value
   divided by 65536.  For example, 0x7FFF as a 0.16 number represents
   the mathematical value 32767/65536, or 0.49998474.  A 1.15 variable
   is interpreted as having one bit before the binary point and 15 bits
   after.  The value of a 1.15 variable is usually the <i>signed</i>
   integer value divided by 32768, which means that it can range between
   -1.0 and +0.9999694.  It's also possible to treat a 1.15 value as
   unsigned, giving it a range from 0 to +1.9999695 (65535/32768).
   The original DCS software mostly uses the signed interpretation,
   but treats these values as unsigned in a few cases.
</p>
<p>
   As far as the bit patterns stored in ADSP-2105 machine registers and
   memory location go, 1.15 and 0.16 numbers are indistinguishable from
   16-bit integers.  You can't tell by looking at an arbitrary memory
   location whether it contains an integer, a 1.15 number, a 1.16 number,
   or something else entirely (an ASCII character, say).  A value stored
   in a memory location is only a fixed-point number when the software
   interprets it that way, and you can only tell if the software is
   going to treat it that way by examining the software code itself.
</p>

<a name="Alignment"></a>
<h3>Alignment</h3>
<p>
   For the most part, the data structures in the DCS ROMs have no
   alignment requirements.  In particular, there's no need to align
   the 16-bit or 24-bit integer types on any particular boundary.
   The DCS boards are physically wired so that the CPU reads from
   the ROMs in units of 8-bit bytes, so at the hardware level, every
   byte in a ROM is individually addressable.
</p>
<p>
   However, there is one object type that does have special alignment
   requirements:  compressed audio streams.  The rules
   are explained in the <a href="#StreamAlignment">Audio Streams</a> section.
</p>

<h3>Linear ROM pointers</h3>
<p>
   Many of the data structures in the ROMs contain pointers to other
   locations in the ROMs.  For example, track programs contain pointers
   to the audio streams they play.  These cross-references from one
   ROM structure to another use a format that I call a "linear
   ROM pointer", which treats the collection of installed ROM
   chips, U2 through U9, as though they were arranged in a single,
   contiguous address space.  The size of this space varies by hardware
   version: for the DCS-93 boards, it's a 23-bit address space, capable
   of spanning 8MB; for the DCS-95 boards, it's a 24-bit space, which
   can address 16MB.
</p>
<p>
   A linear pointer is stored within the ROM as a sequence of 3 bytes.
   This is interpreted as a 24-bit integer value, in the usual big-endian order
   (most significant byte first).  For the DCS-93 boards, where the actual
   pointers only use 23 bits, the high-order bit is ignored when interpreting
   the pointer, and should always be set to zero when stored in the ROM.
</p>
<p>
   The simplest way (for me, at least) to think about the linear ROM
   pointers is to break each address into two bit fields: a <b>chip select</b>
   field and an <b>offset</b> field:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The chip select field is the high-order 3 bits of the 23-bit or
   24-bit pointer.  It thus forms a 3-bit number, 0 to 7, corresponding
   to the ROMs in order, U2 through U9.  0 selects U2, 1 selects U3, etc.

   <li>The rest of the address - the low-order 20 or 21 bits - is the
   offset within the selected chip.
</ul>

<p>
   If you find yourself reading through the ADSP-2105 machine code of
   the original decoder implementations, or if you look at PinMame's
   source code, you'll find that the ADSP-2105 code thinks about these
   pointers in a more convoluted way, slicing and dicing the bits of a pointer
   into two 16-bit registers on each use, using a series of bit-shift
   instructions that looks a lot more complicated than the interpretation
   described above.  We don't have to worry about that when just thinking
   about the <i>data format</i>, though.  The complicated bit-shifting in
   the original decoder is an artifact of the ADSP-2105 implementation
   that's not relevant to the format itself.  The ADSP-2105 only has a
   14-bit address space for data memory, so it has to go through some
   extra steps to access the 8MB to 16MB space that the ROMs comprise,
   by programming a peripheral hardware device on the circuit board to
   map a selected section of a selected ROM into the CPU's small memory space.
   All of the extra bit-shifting work in the ADSP-2105 code relates to
   programming the memory-mapper device, so it's not part of the
   format itself, and it's not relevant to new encoder/decoder
   implementations on modern hardware with large address spaces.  My
   native C++ implementation of the decoder, for example, treats each ROM as a
   single, contiguous byte array, which directly corresponds to the simple
   interpretation of a ROM pointer as a chip-select-plus-offset.
</p>
   


<h2>Physical ROM chip configuration</h2>
<img src="rom-chip.png" class="float-right">
<p>
   All of the program code and audio data for a DCS sound board is
   contained in a set of ROM chips.  The circuit boards have slots for up
   to 8 ROMs, either 512KB or 1MB in size, depending upon the
   hardware version.  The original DCS-93 audio-only boards use
   512KB (512Kb x 8) chips, and the DCS-95 audio/video boards
   use 1MB (1Mb x 8) chips.  The DCS-95 boards were designed in such
   a way that they could be configured at the factory, via a soldered
   jumper, to accept either 1MB or 2MB chips.  All of the boards
   shipped originally in pinball machines apparently use the 1MB
   configuration.  (Williams also used DCS boards in its video
   games of the same era, so it's possible that the 2MB configuration
   was used in some of those.)
</p>
<p>
   The ROM chips are labeled U2 through U9 on the DCS-93 boards
   and S2 through S9 on the DCS-95 boards.  For convenience, I usually
   refer to them as Ux for both generations.
</p>
<p>
   Chip U2 is required on every board, since it contains the ADSP-2105
   program code.  At the hardware level, chips U3 through U9 are
   optional and can be left unpopulated.  They're installed or not in
   each game according to how much space is needed to
   store all of the audio data for the game's soundtrack.  There
   doesn't seem to be anything in the hardware or system software that
   requires the populated ROMs to occupy sequential slots, but that's
   how it's always done in practice: e.g., if a given title has three
   ROM chips, they're always laid out as U2, U3, and U4.  
</p>
<p>
   Note that a given ROM chip is programmed at the factory to occupy
   a specific slot on the board.  You can't arbitrarily move ROMs
   around between slots.  If a ROM is programmed as U3, it
   has to be installed physically in slot U3.
</p>

<h2>Internal ROM layout</h2>

<p>
   Of the eight ROMs, the only one with any significant internal structure
   is the first chip, U2.  This ROM always contains the following elements,
   in the order shown (although the byte offset of each element varies by game).
</p>

   <li>Pause for 250ms, monitoring the data port throughout the pause
   for an incoming byte.
   
   <li>If a byte arrives within 250ms, immediately perform a soft CPU reset,
   which reloads the program memory space from the main decoder program image in U2
   and starts it running.  (The data port byte received is otherwise
   discarded; its value makes no difference.)
   
   <li>If nothing arrives on the data port within 250ms, proceed to the
   self-test procedure:
   <ul>
      <li>For each entry in the ROM catalog, perform a checksum
      (see below) of the corresponding ROM and test it against
      the stored value; if it doesn't match, go immediately to
      the "Report" step, with status code set to 2 + the internal
      chip number of the failing ROM (2 for U2, 3 for U3, etc)

      <li>If all ROM checksums match, run a series of read/write
      tests on RAM (on both Data Memory and Program Memory spaces),
      to check that various bit patterns stored read back as expected;
      on any mismatch, go to the "Report" step, with status code $0A

      <li>Go to the "Report" step with status code 1
   </ul>

   <li><b>Report:</b> Write byte value $79 to the data port, followed by
   the status code byte set above (1 if all self-tests passed successfully,
   2-9 if a checksum failure occurred in the corresponding ROM U2-U9,
   or $0A if the RAM tests failed), then play the startup "bong" that number
   of times, about 750ms per iteration.   (The repeated "bong" provides the operator with
   an audio rendition of the diagnostic code, as a last resort in
   the event that the main board is also failing and can't display
   the diagnostics visually on the DMD.  The main board will
   normally display an error message showing the audio error on
   receiving the $79 xx sequence, and also usually intervenes
   before the sound board can play the repeated bong tone by
   generating an ADSP-2105 CPU reset signal.)

   <li>Perform a soft CPU reset, which reloads the program memory
   space from the main decoder program image in U2 and starts it
   running.
</ul>

<p>
   The purpose of the initial 250ms data port monitoring period
   is that it allows the WPC host to reset the sound board at any
   time, under program control, without having to go through the
   full power-on self-test procedure.  The WPC host has access to
   a hardware port (separate from the communications port that's
   used to send the command bytes) that allows the WPC host to
   assert a hard reset signal on the ADSP-2015 CPU, which forces
   the CPU into its initial boot mode, exactly as though it had
   just been power cycled.  The WPC software exercises this
   authority at certain times, such as whenever the user enters
   or exits the operator menu.  (The forced reset at every operator
   menu invocation is presumably a just-in-case fault-tolerance
   feature, so that if the sound board ever gets itself into a
   bad state where it's not playing audio properly, the problem
   will be fixed as soon as the operator goes into the menu system
   to see what's wrong.)  Normally, a hard reset would trigger
   the time-consuming self-test procedure, but you wouldn't want
   to wait for that if you were doing a just-in-case reset.  So
   when the host wants to reset the sound board without waiting
   for a self-test, it asserts the hard reset signal, and then
   immediately writes a data byte to the command port.  The
   sound board notices the command port byte during the 250ms
   delay period and skips the self tests, going straight into
   its main decoder loop.  When the self tests aren't involved,
   the whole hard reset procedure only takes a few milliseconds,
   making it harmless to execute at any time, as long as you don't
   care that any previously playing audio track will be canceled.
</p>

<h4>Startup bong</h4>
<p>
   The "bong" tone played after the self-test is a 195Hz square
   wave, starting at 100% PCM amplutude, then attenuated with an
   exponential decay envelope by about 0.4% every 1ms.  That is,
   every 1ms, multiply the current square wave amplitude by
   0.996 to get the new square wave amplitude.  The overall
   duration of the tone is 750ms.
</p>
   

<h3>Boot sector signature string</h3>
<p>
    The section at the very beginning of U2 that contains the hard reset
    boot program also contains a "signature" string: human-readable plain text
    that identifies the ROM set, probably so that somebody in possession of
    a loose ROM chip of uncertain origin can read the first few dozen bytes of
    the ROM and see what's there.  The signature string starts at byte offset
    4 and runs for up to about 70 bytes.  It consists of free-form
    ASCII text in the printable character range (code points 32 through 126),
    terminated with a zero byte, usually containing the title
    of the pinball machine the ROM goes with (sometimes shortened, and
    sometimes a nickname, or what might have been an in-house working title,
    rather than the formal production title) and a copyright date.  This ASCII text
    is loaded into the ADSP-2105 program memory space along with the rest of the program
    image, even though the text isn't valid ADSP-2105 executable code; the
    boot program is contrived to jump past these bytes so that the CPU
    doesn't attempt to execute them.
</p>


<h3>Main decoder program</h3>
<p>
   The main decoder program is essentially the DCS operating system.
   It's a fairly complex program with many functions, but its basic
   structure is roughly like this:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Initialize: set up interrupt handlers, load additional program
   code from the "overlays" section, initialize RAM data structures,
   load static data tables from ROM, set the global audio volume to
   the default value of $67, start the DAC "autobuffer" (this is a
   special feature of the ADSP-2105 that's similar to what would today
   be called a DMA controller; it's a hardware peripheral that reads
   one word at a time from a specified memory address range, at regular
   clock intervals, transmitting the data to the DAC, and incrementing the
   read pointer register through a circular buffer cycle)

   <li>Loop forever:
   <ul>
      <li>Process incoming data port commands (which are placed into a
      memory buffer by the data port interrupt handler, asynchronously
      as bytes arrive on the port); each command specifies a track
      program to load and start running

      <li>Execute all active track programs, round-robin, until all
      programs either terminate or reach a "wait" state

      <li>Clear the working audio buffer to all zeros (note: this
      is a separate buffer from the one that the "autobuffer"
      mechanism reads from to feed the DAC)

      <li>Update the audio mixing levels for all channels,
      processing timed fades

      <li>For each channel with an active audio stream, decompress
      one audio frame and add its contribution (after scaling it
      by the channel's current mixing level) to the working audio
      buffer

      <li>Apply an inverse FFT (and some  pre- and post-processing
      steps) to the working audio buffer to reconstruct PCM samples

      <li>Get the current autobuffer read pointer register and
      determine which half of the buffer it's currently in; spin
      until the pointer moves into the <b>other</b> half of the
      buffer (the autobuffer mechanism updates the register
      asynchronously, so the spin loop will eventually terminate
      as the hardware updates the register)
      
      <li>Copy the PCM samples from the working buffer into the
      hardware autobuffer, writing into the half of the buffer
      that the hardware reader is <b>not</b> currently reading from,
      as determined above
   </ul>
</ul>

<p>
   The hardware autobuffer that feeds samples to the DAC is
   480 words, which is twice the size of one audio frame, which
   is 240 words.  The decoder uses the buffer according to
   the widely used double-buffering idiom: the algorithm is
   contrived so that the software decoder is populating one
   half of the buffer while the hardware transfer mechanism is
   reading from the other half.  When the decoder finishes filling
   its half of the frame, it stops and waits for the autobuffer
   read location to cross over into the half of the buffer that
   the decoder just completed, and then starts decoding the next
   frame into the other half of the buffer.  So the decoder and
   the autobuffer reader each swap which half of the buffer
   they're working on at each frame boundary.
</p>
<p>   
   The decoder loop maintains real-time playback synchronization by
   waiting for the autobuffer read pointer to advance into the next
   buffer section on each loop cycle.  The autobuffer advances its
   read pointer according to a hardware clock that's programmed
   to match the samples-per-second rate defined by the DCS format,
   and each frame has a fixed number of samples (240), so it always
   takes the same amount of time for the autobuffer to work through a frame.
   In contrast, the decoder takes a varying amount of time to decode a frame,
   since the decoding work depends to some extent on the frame contents.
   So the decoder has to periodically bring itself into sync with real
   time, which it does by waiting for the autobuffer to "catch up"
   with it at each frame boundary.   This scheme assumes that the
   decoder is always faster than real-time playback; as long as
   that's true, the main loop can synchronize with real time
   simply by burning up the time difference on each cycle waiting for
   the playback pointer to catch up with the decoder output.
   In practice, the decoder <i>is</i> always fast enough
   for this assumption to hold, but even if some pathological
   condition arose where the the decoder fell behind the player,
   it wouldn't be catastrophic: playback would "stutter",
   as the player loops back into a portion of the buffer that
   it already played through once, but it would eventually return
   to normal once the decoder finished with the slow frame.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Volume control:</b>  The audio volume is controlled entirely
   in the digital domain, by applying a scaling factor to the amplitude
   of the PCM samples.  The DCS hardware uses a fixed-gain amplifier,
   so once the PCM stream is converted to an analog signal through
   the DAC, that signal is played back at a fixed gain level.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Saving and restoring the volume setting:</b>  The DCS software
   stores the current audio volume in a volatile RAM location.  The
   DCS board doesn't have any form of non-volatile memory, so this
   setting is lost every time a CPU reset occurs.  The DCS board thus
   depends upon the host to save the volume setting across resets
   and transmit it via the data port.  The
   WPC software is designed with this requirement in mind, and does,
   in fact, send a volume command to the data port after each sound
   board reset that it initiates.  If the sound board resets on
   its own due to a software or hardware fault, the WPC board doesn't
   have any way to detect this, nor is there any way for the sound
   board to solicit an update on its own, so the volume level after
   a spontaneous reset will be stuck at the default value of $67
   (equivalent to 12 on the 0-31 scale in the user interface)
   until the user manually adjusts it, or until the WPC software
   initiates a sound-board reset for some reason (such as the user
   entering the operator menu).
</p>

<h3>ROM catalog</h3>
<p>
   The ROM catalog consists of 8 entries of 6 bytes each, plus a
   two-byte end marker.
</p>

<img class="ex" src="rom-catalog.png">
<div class="caption">
   Figure 3a. ROM catalog layout
</div>
   
<img class="ex" src="rom-catalog-entry.png">
<div class="caption">
   Figure 3b. Layout of each entry in the ROM catalog
</div>

<p>
   The table contains one entry per chip in the ROM set.  The end
   of the table is marked with $0000 in the size field of the
   first slot that isn't occupied.  If all
   eight slots are occupied, the extra $0000 word after the 8th
   slot serves as the end marker.
</p>
<p>
   The DCS software doesn't contain any assumptions that the table
   is in any particular order, so other applications should likewise
   make no such assumptions.  In practice, though, all of the DCS ROMs
   order the entries by chip number, so the entry for
   U2 is always in the first slot, U3 is always in the second
   slot, and so forth.
</p>   
<p>
   Each entry consists of three 16-bit
   integer fields (in big-endian byte order, as in all DCS integer types).

</table>

<h3>ROM checksum computation</h3>

<p>
   Each checksum is a 16-bit value computed as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Add up the byte values of all of the bytes at <b>even offsets</b>
   in the ROM, mod 256

   <li>Add up the byte values of all of the bytes at <b>odd offsets</b>
   in the ROM, mod 256

   <li>Calculate the 16-bit result as the even-offset sum shifted left
   by 8 bits plus the odd-offset sum; in C notation, <tt>((even_sum &lt;&lt; 8) | odd_sum)</tt>
</ul>
<p>
   (Equivalently, you could think of there being two separate 8-bit checksums,
   one that sums all of the bytes at even offsets the other at odd addresses.)
</p>
<p>
   To compute the mod 256 sums, you can simply use an 8-bit register or variable
   for the running total, discarding all overflow bits in the intermediate
   results.  Or, if it's more convenient, you can get the same result by adding
   all of the bytes together in a wider variable (a UINT16, UINT32, etc) and
   then keeping only the low-order 8 bits of the final sum, either
   by narrowing the variable type to 8 bits or by masking the result
   (applying a bitwise AND) with $FF.
</p>
<p>
   Note that the checksum in the catalog entry representing U2 is a little tricky to
   get right when creating a ROM, because the U2 checksum bytes are themselves
   part of U2, hence they're included in the calculation the U2 checksum.
   A program that's creating a ROM in this format must thus contrive
   for the checksums to come out right.  In particular, you can't just
   compute the checksum of U2 and then plug the result into the ROM
   catalog entry for U2, because doing so changes the contents of U2
   and thus changes its checksum.  You can repeat that process forever
   and it'll never converge.  One way to solve this is to reserve two spare
   bytes (one at an even address, one at an odd address)
   elsewhere in the U2 space to use as free variables for satisfying the
   checksum constraint.  First, set the checksum field in the catalog
   entry representing U2 to hand-picked
   values, say $0000, then add up all of the bytes in the ROM <i>except</i>
   the spare bytes, then set the spare bytes to the unique values that, when
   added to the all-of-the-other-bytes total, yield the hand-picked checksum
   value chosen earlier.  (These unique values are easy to figure for DCS's simple
   linear checksum calculation: just subtract the all-of-the-other-bytes
   totals from your chosen checksum bytes mod 256.)   The software that
   Williams used to create the DCS ROMs probably used this exact
   procedure, because the U2 checksums are in fact always zero.
</p>
      


<h3>How to find the U2 ROM catalog</h3>
<p>
   Of the variably-located sections, the one that's of most
   interest to external applications is the ROM catalog.  The audio
   index is equally important, but we can easily find
   that as soon as we know the location of the catalog, and
   the catalog is easier to identify, so it's the place to start.
</p>
<p>
   The ROMs don't contain enough self-description metadata that we can 
   create a simple formula to figure the location of the catalog, but
   we can find it by applying some heuristics.
</p>
<p>
   First, the catalog in every DCS pinball ROM is at one of three fixed
   offsets within U2: $03000, $04000, or $06000.  We only have to
   look in each of those three locations, and we should always find
   the catalog in one of them.
</p>
<p>
   Second, it's fairly easy to determine whether or not the 50 bytes
   at one of these locations is the catalog.  The most reliable way is
   to compute the checksums for all of the ROMs on hand and test each
   candidate catalog location to see if it contains the correct
   size and checksum value in each slot.  It's extremely unlikely that some
   random data that's <i>not</i> the catalog would accidentally
   contain the matching values.  A less reliable (but still pretty
   reliable) way is to simply parse each potential catalog section
   to see if the chip number and size values are within the valid range
   (chip numbers 0 through 7, and size values of either 128 or 256,
   for 512K and 1MB chips respectively).  If all of the entries are
   in range, there's a very good chance that this is the catalog,
   because the valid ranges are so tightly constrained that it's
   unlikely that non-catalog data would be in range for every slot.
</p>

<a name="AudioIndex"></a>
<h3>Audio index</h3>
<p>
   The audio index consists of three entries, located $40 hex
   (64 decimal) bytes after the start of the ROM catalog.
   The byte offsets shown in the table below are from the
   start of the ROM catalog.

<h4>Track program index</h4>
<p>
   The audio index contains a 24-bit pointer to the track program index.
   The track program index is a contiguous, packed array of 24-bit pointers
   to track programs.  Each entry in the track program index is a pointer to
   the first byte of the corresponding track program.
</p>
<p>
   Each entry in the track program index corresponds to a track  number,
   starting at 0, and increasing by 1 at each position.  The number
   of elements in the array is specified in the "Number of track programs"
   field in the audio index.
</p>
<p>
   Many track numbers are unused in a given ROM.  An index entry for an
   unused track number is filled with three $FF bytes.  (Note that it's
   $FF bytes, <b>not</b> zeros.)
</p>
<p>
   To find a track by number, multiply the track number by 3 and
   add it to the track index pointer from the audio index.  This
   gives the location of the 24-bit pointer to the first byte
   of the track data.
</p>
<p>
   See <a href="#TrackPrograms">Track Programs</a> for details on
   the contents of these objects.

<a name="DeferredIndirectIndex"></a>
<h4>Deferred Indirect table index</h3>
<p>
   This feature is implemented in all of the DCS software versions,
   so you'll find a slot for this table in every ROM, but none
   of the pinball games ever used it.
   See <a href="#Deferred">Deferred Tracks</a> for a general
   description of the mechanism.
</p>
<p>
   The Deferred Indirect table index pointer in the audio index
   is a UINT24 linear ROM pointer to an array of UINT24 pointers
   that I call the Deferred Indirect table index.  This contains
   one entry per Deferred Indirect table.
</p>
<p>
   Each element of the Deferred Indirect table index is itself
   a UINT24 linear ROM pointer, which points to the table
   corresponding to the index slot.  Each table is yet
   another array, this time an array of
   UINT16 elements, containing track numbers.
</p>


<img class="ex" src="deferred-indirect-index.png">
<div class="caption">
   Figure 4. Deferred Indirect table indexing structure
</div>

<p>
   There's no metadata in the ROM (as far as I can tell) that
   indicates how many entries the Deferred Indirect table
   index contains, nor how many entries are in each individual
   table.  The sections of the software that access these
   tables don't do any range checking; they just count on
   the ROM data not to make invalid references.  Assuming
   that there aren't any invalid references, the sizes of the
   tables can be inferred as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>For the deferred indirect table index:</b>
   Scan the entire track index for tracks marked with type
   code 3. For each one found, read the low byte of the
   UINT16 that forms the track's body, and note
   the highest value found for all of these low bytes.  This
   tells you the highest index value that any track can use to
   access the table index, so if this value is N, the table
   index must have a minimum of N+1 elements.

   <li><b>For the individual track number tables:</b>
   First, go through the track index, and parse
   the full byte-code program for every type 1 track.  For
   each opcode $06 instruction found, note that variable
   number and the value assigned; if the value assigned is
   the highest noted so far for the variable, record it as
   the new maximum value for that variable.  Upon completing
   this scan, you'll have a list giving you the maximum
   value that each variable is ever assigned.  Now go
   through track track index and scan for type 3 deferred
   tracks.  For each one, note the table index (in
   the low byte of the UINT16 track payload) and variable
   number (in the high byte of the UINT16 payload).  Look
   up the variable in the maximum variable value list
   compiled in the first step.  Note the highest maximum
   variable value among all of the variables associated with
   each table in this manner - the maximum of the maxima.
   The highest assigned value for all of the variables
   associated with a given table via type 3 tracks tells
   you the highest index value that can ever be used with
   that table, which tells you the size of the table.
</ul>

<p>
   Note that the algorithms above assume that the ROM
   doesn't contain any invalid references (past the ends
   of any of the tables).  Both scans also can only tell
   you the <i>reachable</i> size of the tables - the number
   of entries actually referenced somewhere in the ROM.
   It's possible for the tables to have extra entries past
   their reachable portions, which we have no way to detect.
   However, it's irrelevant if they do, since unreachable
   entries can never be accessed and are thus can be ignored
   for any purpose for which you'd need to know the sizes of the tables.
</p>


<h3>Audio data</h3>
<p>
   The audio data section has no structure.  It's just a
   collection of audio streams in the DCS format, strung together
   one after another to fill out the available space.  Each stream
   must start on either an even address or an odd address, depending
   on the stream format, so there's up to one byte of padding between
   adjacent streams when needed to meet the alignment requirement
   for the next stream.
</p>
<p>
   As far as I can tell, the ROMs don't contain any sort of index
   to the audio streams, and the streams themselves don't have any
   recognizable markers that indicate where they start or end
   or how they're internally structured.  So there's no way to
   scan from a random starting point in the ROM and detect where
   the next stream starts, for example.
</p>
<p>
   Even so, it <i>is</i> possible to exhaustively enumerate all
   of the playable streams.  Every playable stream is reachable
   from an opcode $01 instruction in a track program, and the
   track programs are all reachable from the track index.  We
   can use this to find the starting address of every stream,
   by iterating over all of the track numbers, and parsing
   all of the opcodes in each track's program to find instances
   of opcode $01.
</p>
<p>
   Even knowing the starting location of a stream, we still can't
   easily determine its length in bytes.  The first UINT16
   in a stream indicates the number of DCS frames the stream
   contains, but that doesn't translate directly to bytes.
   The rest of the stream is just a packed array of bits
   representing the frame data, with no internal metadata or
   markers.  Determining the byte length of a stream thus requires
   decoding the entire stream.  That is, in fact, how DCS Explorer
   determines the byte size of streams when listing or extracting them.
</p>
<p>
   Short of fully decoding each stream, the only way to guess at
   the length of a stream would be to enumerate the starts of all of the
   streams, place these in address order, and assume that all
   of the bytes from the start of one stream to the start of
   the next stream in address order belong to the first stream.
   That would yield a reliable upper bound for the length
   of each stream, although it might (harmlessly) include some
   extra bytes that aren't actually part of the stream, such
   as padding bytes between streams, or other object types
   that were placed between streams in the memory layout. As
   far as I know, there aren't any such non-stream objects in
   the audio data section of the ROMs, but it's possible that
   there are other types I haven't accounted for yet.  At any
   rate, it would be harmless to include any such extra bytes
   as part of a stream if you were, say, extracting the stream
   to an external file; the extra bytes would just be meaningless
   garbage after the end of the stream that a decoder would
   know not to read simply by virtue of running out of frames
   before reaching them.
</p>

<h3>Unused space</h3>

<p>
   Unused space at the end of a DCS ROM is typically filled
   with $FF bytes.
</p>

<h3>U3-U9 internal layout</h3>

<p>
   ROMs U3 through U9 each contain a small, ad hoc signature string,
   and after that simply continue the "Audio Data" section from U2,
   containing more audio streams packed end-on-end, with up to one byte
   of padding between adjacent streams to meet even or odd alignment
   requirements per stream.  Each stream must be fully contained within a single
   ROM chip (a stream can't be split across two ROMs).
</p>
   

<img class="ex" src="u3-u9-layout.png">
<div class="caption">
   Figure 5. Internal data map for ROMs U3 through U9
</div>

<p>
   The signature strings in ROMs U3 through U9 always start at
   the first byte of the ROM image.  They consist of ASCII text,
   typically of the form <b>U3 11/19/95</b> - that is, the chip
   number and a date, presumably the build date for the ROM image.
   The exact format varies, and some games have additional ad hoc
   text mixed in.  The signature always (as far as I've seen) ends
   with a zero byte, in the style of a C programming language
   zero-terminated string.

<h2>Track Programs</h2>

<p>
   Most commands that the WPC board sends to the sound board are
   treated as track commands, which load tracks by number.  There
   are also a handful of special commands that the operating system
   software handles directly, rather than as track command lookups;
   see <a href="#SpecialCommands">Special Commands</a>.  Any command
   that's not a special command, though, is just a track number.
</p>
<p>
   A track command from the WPC board is a two-byte sequence
   that forms a big-endian UINT16 whose value is not between
   $55AA and $55FF (that range is reserved for the special
   commands that the operating system processes directly).  The
   UINT16 value is used as an array index into the Track Program
   Index table, whose location is obtained from the
   <a href="#AudioIndex">Audio Index</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The Track Program Index is an array of UINT24 linear ROM
   pointers.  To look up a track in the index, multiply the track
   number by 3, and add the result to the Track Program Index
   pointer value from the Audio Index.  Read the UINT24 linear
   ROM pointer from the resulting address.  If the high byte is $FF,
   the track slot is unoccupied, and DCS ignores the track command.
   Otherwise, read the first two bytes from the location
   represented by the pointer, and interpret them as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The first byte is the track's channel number, 0-3 or 0-5 (depending
   on the software version)
   <li>The second byte is the track type code:
   <ul>
      <li>1 = Byte-code program
      <li>2 = Deferred track
      <li>3 = Deferred Indirect track
      <li>Other type codes are invalid; the DCS software performs a soft reset if it
      encounters any other value, on the assumption that something in its memory
      state is corrupted
   </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Byte-code programs</h3>

<p>
   A track with type code 1 contains a byte-code program, starting at
   the first byte after the track type code byte.  The program consists
   of a series of instructions coded in a special byte-code language
   defined by DCS.  The byte-code language can be thought of as similar
   to a microprocessor's machine code instruction set, but it's
   not real machine code for the ADSP-2105 or any other physical
   CPU.  It's just a made-up language, defined by the DCS software and
   used only for implementing these track programs.
</p>
<p>
   As in a typical CPU instruction set, the byte-code instructions
   are executed sequentially, one at a time, in the order in which
   they appear in memory.
</p>
<p>
   Each instruction has two fixed fields: a two byte "Wait" prefix,
   as a UINT16 value (two bytes in big-endian order),
   and a one-byte "opcode", which specifies the operation to perform
   at this step.  These three fixed bytes are followed by a varying
   number of operand bytes, the number and meaning of which are
   specific to each opcode.  Not all opcodes have any operand bytes,
   in which case the three fixed bytes constitute that entire instruction.
</p>
<p>
   There's no padding between instructions.  The last operand byte
   of an instruction is followed immediately by the first Wait prefix
   byte of the next instruction.
</p>

<h4>Wait prefix</h4>

<p>
   Every instruction starts with a UINT16 Wait prefix.  This specifies
   a wait time <i>before</i> executing the associated instruction,
   measured in DCS audio frames.  This can be zero to indicate
   that the instruction is to be executed immediately with no
   waiting.  The special value $FFFF means "wait forever".
</p>
<p>
   When the byte-code execution subroutine runs on a channel,
   it executes one instruction at a time in a loop until
   encountering an instruction with a non-zero wait prefix.
   At that point, it sets a wait time counter in the channel
   to the wait prefix value, and then returns to the main loop, suspending the program
   until the wait elapses.  Execution on the channel resumes
   after the main loop has completed N iterations, where N is
   the number of frames specified in the wait prefix.  When
   the wait prefix is $FFFF, the program is suspended forever.
   (A permanently suspended program doesn't freeze the
   channel forever, because it can still be terminated by an
   outside event, such as a new command from the WPC host
   that loads a new track program into the same channel.)
</p>


<h4>Opcodes</h4>

<p>
   <b>$00 / End of Track</b><br>
   Marks the end
   of the track program.  The track program and current audio stream
   pointers for the channel are reset, stopping any audio playback
   currently occurring on the channel.  The byte-code execution
   subroutine returns to the main loop.  This should always be used
   as the last instruction in every track program.
</p>

<p>
   <b>$01 UINT8(channel) UINT24(stream-pointer) UINT8(repeats) / Play Stream</b><br>
   Loads the specified stream (at the given linear ROM pointer address) into
   the specified channel, which need not be the track program's own channel,
   and starts it playing.  Sets the repeat count as specified.  The special
   repeat count value 0 means "loop forever".
</p>

<p>
   <b>$02 UINT8(channel) / Stop Channel</b><br>
   Stops all track program
   execution and audio stream playback in the specified channel number.
   If the channel is the same as the track's containing channel, this
   immediately terminates the current track program.
</p>

<p>
   <b>$03 UINT16(track-number) / Queue Track</b><br>
   Queues the specified
   track number for playback, exactly as though the WPC board had sent
   the track number to the data port as a command code.  The track number
   is placed in the same internal memory queue used to hold command codes
   received through the data port, so it's not processed until the next
   incoming command processing step in the main loop.  The queuing aspect has the
   important implication that the new track doesn't interrupt the current
   track program for the duration of the current frame, even if the new
   track occupies the same channel.
</p>

<p>
   <b>$04 UINT8(byte) / Write Data Port</b> <span style="padding-left: 3em;"><i>1993a software only</i></span><br>
   Writes the specified byte
   value to the data port, which sends the byte to the WPC host board.
   (This variant of the opcode applies to all
   ROM versions except the early 1993 software version shipped with <i>Indiana Jones:
   The Pinball Adventure</i> and <i>Judge Dredd</i>, which use the
   Set Channel Timer variant below.)
</p>
<p>
   Special side-effect for decoder software 1.05: For this decoder
   software version only, two specific byte values have special side effects:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>$69 = enable <a href="#Channel5VolumeOverrideHack">global volume override</a> on channel 5
   <li>$6A = disable global volume override on channel 5
</ul>
<p>
   The "global volume override" on channel 5 makes this channel act as though
   the <a href="#MasterVolumeLevel">master volume setting</a> were turned all the
   way up to $FF, regardless of its actual setting.  This only affects channel 5.
   The flag is automatically cleared any time a new stream being playback
   on channel 5 via opcode $02.
</p>

<p>
   <b>$04 UINT8(byte) UINT16(counter) / Set Channel Timer</b> <span style="padding-left: 3em;"><i>1993b/1994+ software only</i></span><br>
   If the
   byte value is non-zero, write it immediately to the data port, and
   set the channel timer according to the "counter" value.  To set the
   channel timer, load the counter into the channel's interval timer
   slot, and load the byte value into the channel's data value slot.   if the
   byte value is zero, simply clear the channel timer, without writing
   anything to the data port.  The counter value is ignored when the
   byte value is zero - the data port is always simply cleared in this case.
   (This variant of the instruction is only implemented in the early 1993
   software version shipped with
   <i>IJ:TPA</i> and <i>JD</i>; the Write Data Port variant above is
   used instead in every other software version.)
</p>
<p>
   ("Channel timers" are implemented in every version of the software,
   but are only accessible in the early 1993 software; the code
   implementing the timers is effectively vestigial in all later versions
   because it's impossible to program the timers.  The channel timers
   simply keep track of an interval (measured as always in DCS audio
   frames) and a data port byte value.  Every time the interval
   elapses, the byte value is sent to the data port.  Setting the
   interval to zero clears the timer.  They're called <i>channel</i> timers
   because there's one such data structure per channel.)
</p>

<p>
   <b>$05 UINT8(channel) / Start Deferred</b><br>
   Triggers the pending deferred
   track on the specified channel, if any.  If the channel's "pending next
   track type" slot is empty, the opcode does nothing at all.  If the
   slot is set to type 2 (plain deferred) or type 3 (deferred indirect),
   the specified track is queued, exactly as though it were queued via
   opcode $03.  See <a href="#Deferred">Deferred Tracks</a> for a more
   detailed explanation of the deferred track mechanism.
</p>

<p>
   <b>$06 / No-Op</b><span style="padding-left: 3em;"><i>1993 software only</i></span><br>
   This instruction is a no-op for the 1993 games, with no operand bytes.
</p>

<p>
   <b>$06 UINT8(index) UINT8(value) / Set Variable</b> <span style="padding-left: 3em;"><i>1994+ software only</i></span><br>
   Sets the variable at the given index to the given value.  The "variables" are simply
   slots in memory where these values can be stored, so you can also
   think of this as setting the <i>index</i>th element in an array of bytes.
   The only use of these variables is in <a href="#Deferred">Deferred Indirect</a>
   tracks, which specify the pending track in terms of a table to be
   indexed by one of these variables.
</p>
<p>
   Note that the upper limit for the index
   is unclear, but it appears that around 80 slots are reserved in memory
   for these variables in the original ADSP-2105 decoder implementations.
   New decoder implementations should allow for 256 variables, so that
   any possible value of index can be safely used, while encoders should limit
   the index value to the range 0-79 to avoid corrupting memory when run under
   original ADSP-2105 implementations. The original ROM software doesn't
   range-check the index but does appear to reserve substantially fewer
   than 256 slots in memory.
</p>

<p>
   <b>$07 UINT8(channel) INT8(level) / Set Mixing Level</b><br>
   <b>$08 UINT8(channel) INT8(delta) / Increase Mixing Level</b><br>
   <b>$09 UINT8(channel) INT8(delta) / Decrease Mixing Level</b><br>
   Change the mixing level for the specified channel.  The change
   is applied immediately (with no fade interval).  Opcode $07 specifies the
   new level in absolute terms; opcodes $08 and $09 specify the new level relative
   to the current level, adding or subtracting the given delta.
   Note that the level/delta operand is interpreted as a <b>signed</b> 8-bit value, -128 to +127.
   See <a href="#Mixer">Channel Mixer</a> for details on how the mixing scheme works.
</p>
      
<p>
   <b>$0A UINT8(channel) INT8(level) UINT16(frames) / Set Mixing Level with Fade</b><br>

   <b>$0C UINT8(channel) INT8(delta) UINT16(frames) / Decrease Mixing Level with Fade</b><br>
   Change the mixing level for the specified channel, gradually
   adjusting it from the current level to the new level over
   the given number of audio frames.  Opcode $0A specifies the new level
   in absolute terms; opcodes $0B and $0C specify it relative to the channel's
   current level, adding or subtracting the given delta.
   Note that the level/delta operand is interpreted as a <b>signed</b> 8-bit value, -128 to +127.
   See <a href="#Mixer">Channel Mixer</a> for details on how the mixing scheme works.
</p>

<p>
   <b>$0D / NOP</b><br>
   No Operation - does nothing.
</p>

<p>
   <b>$0E UINT8(counter) / Start Loop</b><br>
   Marks the start of a looping section.  If the counter value is zero,
   the loop is infinite; if it's non-zero, the loop iterates the specified
   number of times.  Loops can be nested within other loops.
</p>

<p>
   <b>$0F / End Loop</b><br>
   Marks the end of a looping section started earlier in the same program
   with opcode $0E.  If the loop counter has reached the number of iterations
   specified in the $0E instruction, control continues to the next instruction
   following the end of the loop; otherwise control returns to the top of
   the loop (the instruction immediately following the $0E instruction that
   opened the loop).

   <b>$10 UINT8() UINT8()</b><br>
   <b>$11 UINT8() UINT8() UINT16()</b><br>
   <b>$11 UINT8() UINT8() UINT16()</b><br>
   No known function.  Handlers for these opcodes first appear in
   the software for the DCS-95 boards.  The handlers load some data based
   on the operand bytes into internal memory structures associated with
   the channel, but these memory locations are never used anywhere else
   in the code, so the instructions ultimately cannot have any effect.
   The handlers must represent some planned feature that was started
   but abandoned before it was finished.  The data structures
   involved are also written by the $55BA series of <a href="#SpecialCommands">special command codes</a>,
   so the two are probably related.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Other</b><br>
   All other byte values are invalid as opcodes.  The DCS ROM software
   performs a soft reset on the CPU on encountering any invalid opcode,
   on the assumption that something in its internal memory state must
   be corrupted.
</p>


<h3>Deferred and Deferred Indirect</h3>

<p>
   Type codes 2 and 3 are deferred tracks.   These tracks don't have associated
   byte-code programs; the payload is simply a UINT16 value, stored as two
   bytes in big-endian format, immediately following the track type code byte.
</p>
<p>
   Loading a deferred track doesn't affect the currently playing stream or
   track program in the channel.  Instead, it loads the UINT16 value into the
   channel's "pending track" slot, and loads the deferred type code (2 or 3)
   into the channel's "pending track type" slot.  Loading those two values
   completes processing of the deferred track command.
</p>
<p>
   See <a href="#Deferred">Deferred Tracks</a> for more details on the
   deferral mechanisms.
</p>


<a name="Deferred"></a>
<h2>Deferred Tracks</h2>

<p>
   The "Deferred Track" mechanism lets the sound designer
   indicate that a given track command doesn't start playing its
   track program immediately when the WPC host sends the command,
   but rather sets up a separate target track for future
   play, to be started when a corresponding event occurs in a
   <i>third</i> track program's execution.
</p>
<p>
   The purpose of this
   mechanism is to synchronize the transition to the new track
   on a selected music beat, to make the transition sound seamless
   to the user, without the need for the WPC host to precisely
   time the event.  The WPC host can't easily synchronize
   sound events with precision because its software runs
   asynchronously from the sound board, and the data port
   mechanism that connects the two isn't designed for real-time
   event coordination.  The sound board, in contrast, can easily
   synchronize actions with frame-precise points in playback, since
   everything the sound software does is based on the frame
   timing.
</p>
<p>
   There are two flavors of deferred tracks: "plain" deferred
   tracks, marked in the track program with type code 2; and
   "deferred indirect" tracks, marked with type code 3.
</p>

<h3>Plain deferred tracks</h3>
<p>
   A plain deferred track (track type code 2) is simple: in
   lieu of a byte-code program, the track's body consists only
   of a UINT16 value (two bytes, unsigned, big-endian), which
   is interpreted as a track number.  I call this the "target"
   track because it's the one that actually gets played (eventually)
   when the deferred track is loaded by a WPC command.
   For example, suppose that track $0010 is coded as a type 2
   deferred track on channel 0, and the UINT16 value stored as
   its content body is $0020.  When the WPC host sends command
   code $0010, the DCS board looks up track $0010.  There, it
   finds type code 2, indicating a plain deferred track, so it reads a UINT16
   value from the track $0010's body, which yields $0020.  DCS
   stores $0020 in the special memory location for "pending
   deferred track on channel 0", along with the deferred-type-2 code.
</p>
<p>
   That completes the command processing for command $0010, since
   a deferred track has no byte-code program of its own.
</p>
<p>
   The value $0020 now sits lurking in the "pending" memory location,
   waiting until some <i>other</i> track - one that's actively executing -
   executes an opcode $05 with channel $00 as its operand.
   That opcode has the effect of reading the "pending" memory
   location for the channel specified in the opcode, and
   immediately loading the track number found there into
   its channel.  (This also clears the "pending" location on
   the channel, since starting the track completes the whole deferral operation.)
   If the "pending" location doesn't contain a type 2 or type 3
   track number at the time an opcode $05 executes, the opcode
   $05 simply has no effect.
</p>

<h3>Deferred Indirect tracks</h3>
<p>
   A Deferred Indirect track (track type code 3) is an elaboration
   of the plain deferred scheme that allows the source track to
   specify a <b>list of target tracks</b> to choose from when an opcode
   $05 triggers the pending track on the channel.
</p>
<p>
   Like a plain deferred track, a Deferred Indirect track's body
   consists only of a UINT16 value; for both deferred types,
   there's no byte-code program associated with a deferred track.
   The UINT16 in a Deferred Indirect track has a different
   interpretation, though.  The low byte is the index of a
   Deferred Indirect Table, and the high byte is the index of
   an opcode $06 variable.  As with plain deferred tracks,
   loading a Deferred Indirect track by way of a command from
   the WPC host simply loads the UINT16 value into the "pending"
   register for the track's channel, and has no other immediate
   effect.
</p>
<p>
   When an opcode $05 targeting the same channel is next executed
   in a running track program, DCS reads the "pending" register
   for the channel and sees that it contains a type 3 Deferred Indirect
   code.  It breaks the pending UINT16 code into the two parts
   (table index and variable index), reads the current value
   of the variable, and uses the value as an index into the
   selected table.  The UINT16 at the selected table's selected
   element gives the final track number to load.
</p>
<p>
   The Deferred Indirect tables are found via the Deferred Indirect
   index pointer in the <a href="#AudioIndex">audio index</a>.  The
   audio index entry is a UINT24 linear ROM pointer that points to
   the start of the Deferred Indirect index.  The index in turn is
   an array of UINT24 linear ROM pointers, indexed by Deferred
   Indirect table index (starting at zero), with each element
   pointing to a single Deferred Indirect table.  Each table is
   in turn an array of UINT16 elements containing track numbers.
   See <a href="#DeferredIndirectIndex">Deferred Indirect table index</a>
   for more on the layout of the table structures.
</p>
<p>
   None of the original DCS pinball ROMs use the Deferred Indirect feature,
   even though it's implemented in all of the DCS software versions.
</p>


<a name="Streams"></a>
<h2>Audio Streams</h2>

<p>
   An audio stream encodes a sequence of PCM audio samples,
   using a compression system that substantially reduces the
   amount of storage needed to represent the data as compared
   with the plain PCM representation.  A stream represents a
   linear time sequence of samples to be played back from
   start to finish.
</p>
<p>
   The DCS stream encoding is conceptually similar to mainstream
   lossy audio compression systems such as MP3 and Vorbis,
   although it differs in the details, since it was
   developed independently before those standards were created;
   plus, it was designed only for use in embedded systems,
   where there was no need to conform to outside standards.
</p>
<p>
   All of the similar lossy compression formats use a similar
   mathematical foundation.  They start with a sequence of PCM
   samples taken at a uniform sampling interval.  This
   sequence is divided into "frames" - fixed-length time windows
   within the overall sequence consisting of some manageable
   fixed number of samples (256 in the case of DCS).  Each
   frame is transformed into the frequency domain,
   using a discrete integral transform, either a discrete Fourier
   transform or one of the related transforms, such as the
   discrete cosine transform.  The samples,
   now in the frequency domain, are then re-quantized with a
   reduced number of bits that varies from sample to sample,
   trading off compression against how much of the original
   signal's detail is retained.  Finally,
   the re-quantized samples are encoded into a bit stream,
   possibly using entropic coding to further reduce the
   average number of bits of storage required per sample.
   (Entropic coding uses a Huffman-like code with a varying
   number of bits per sample, encoding more common values
   with shorter codewords and less common values with longer
   codewords, similar to Zip file compression.)
</p>
<p>
   Most of the compression in these systems comes
   from the re-quantization step, which represents the samples
   at lower resolution than was used to collect the original
   PCM samples and thus requires less space to store.  Some
   additional compression is gained from entropic coding of
   the resulting samples.   In sophisticated encoders, the
   re-quantization step is driven by a "psycho-acoustic" model,
   which attempts to determine which portions of the signal
   are more and less audible to a human listener, so that
   it can preferentially allocate bits to the parts of the signal
   that are the most audible, and discard the portions that are
   inaudible or barely audible.
</p>

<a name="Frames"></a>
<h3>Frames</h3>
<p>
   All of the DCS formats work in terms of "frames": 8.192ms
   time windows, containing 256 PCM samples at 31,250 samples
   per second.
</p>
<p>
   Converting between the raw stream of PCM samples of the
   original source material and the DCS frames is a little
   more complicated than just chopping the stream into 256-sample
   sections, because each DCS frame overlaps each adjacent
   frame by 16 samples, as shown in Figure 6.
   Furthermore, the samples in the overlapping sections are
   modified by a "window function", which means that they're
   multiplied by a set of coefficients during encoding, and
   then multiplied by the inverse coefficients during decoding.

<p>
   During encoding, the raw PCM sample stream is divided into
   frames as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Copy the next 256 samples from the stream into a
   working frame buffer.
   
   <li>Advance the stream read pointer by 240 samples (so that the
   16 samples at the end of the current frame are read again as
   the first 16 samples of the next frame).
   
   <li>In the working frame buffer, multiply the first 16 samples
   (elements 0 through 15) and last 16 samples (elements 240 through 255)
   by the window function coefficients:

   <pre>
   for (int i = 0 ; i < 15 ; ++i)
   {
      float c = windowFunctionCoefficients[i];
      frameBuffer[i] *= c;
      frameBuffer[255-i] *= c;
   }</pre>
   <p>
      Note the symmetry: the first sample and last sample are
      multiplied by the same coefficient, as are the second sample
      and second-to-last, and so on.
   </p>
   <p>
      The window function is constrained, but not specified, by the DCS
      format, or more specifically, by the original decoder implementation.
      The reference decoders use pre-defined constant coefficients
      to undo the windowing when reconstructing the signal, and these
      constants constrain the encoder's choice of window coefficients.
      See <a href="#WindowFunc">Encoding Window Function</a> for a specific
      window function you can use, and an explanation of how to choose your
      own custom window function that satisfies the constraints if you
      don't want to use the one I came up with.
   </p>

   <li>Repeat until reaching the end of the input stream.
</ul>

<p>
   The decoding process reverses these steps, by mixing together
   the overlapping section of each pair of adjacent frames
   using the inverse of the encoding coefficients.  To implement
   this, the decoder must maintain a 16-element <b>overlap buffer</b>
   from frame to frame.  Clear this to all zeros when the program
   starts, and then just let it carry over from frame to frame after that.
   Decoding then proceeds as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Copy the first 240 samples from the current frame
   into the PCM output buffer.

   <li>Combine the first 16 samples of the PCM output buffer with
   the 16 samples in the overlap buffer left over from the previous
   frame, using the pre-defined coefficients and the algorithm
   listed below.  (These are fixed constants defined in the original
   DCS decoders, so new decoders must use the same values.  All of
   the original DCS decoder versions from 1993 to 1998 use the same
   constants.)
   <pre>
static const float decodingOverlapCoeff[] = {
    0.009644f, 0.056274f, 0.129395f, 0.225952f,
    0.343445f, 0.476776f, 0.616882f, 0.751251f,
    0.866577f, 0.952942f, 1.006805f, 1.031403f,
    1.034271f, 1.024597f, 1.011169f, 1.001465f
};
for (int i = 0 ; i < 16 ; ++i) {
    pcmBuffer[i] =
        (pcmBuffer[i] * decodingOverlapCoeff[i])
        + (overlapBuffer[i] * decodingOverlapCoeff[15 - i]);
};
</pre>
   <p>
      The original ADSP-2105 code used 16-bit fixed-point arithmetic to
      perform the overlap mixing step.  See <a href="#OverlapCoefficientInts">Integer Frame Overlap Coefficients</a>
      for the fixed-point equivalents of the coefficients.
   </p>

   <li>Copy the last 16 samples from the transformed frame
   into the overlap buffer.  (These are the leftover 16 samples
   from the current frame that weren't included in the PCM output
   buffer for the current frame - recall that we only used
   the first 240 samples from the frame for the PCM output.)

   <li>Repeat until reaching the last frame.
</ul>

<p>
   Each frame contains 256 PCM samples, representing a time
   window of 8.192ms, but due to the overlap, only 240 samples
   from each frame are used during playback.  Each frame
   thus takes 7.68ms to play back.

<h3>Encoding procedure overview</h3>

<p>
   Here's the procedure, in very general terms, for converting an
   audio stream from raw audio data into a DCS stream object:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Quantize the audio into signed 16-bit linear PCM samples
   at a uniform sampling rate of 31,250 samples per second.

   <li>Arrange the samples in a continuous sequence in time order.

   <li>Divide the sequence into overlapping frames of 256 samples
   each, as described in <a href="#Frames">Frames</a> above.

   <li>Apply the encoding window function coefficients to the first
   and last 16 samples of each frame.

   <li>Transform each frame from the time domain into the
   frequency domain; the precise algorithm is discussed below.

   <li>Divide each frame into bands, per the target format's
   band definitions.

   <li>Within each band, choose the bit width to use to
   store the samples in the final stream, based on the range
   of samples in the band and the desired retained resolution.

   <li>Scale the samples to the selected bit width and
   encode them into the stream, using the pre-defined DCS
   codebook for the stream type.
</ul>

<h4>Choosing the encoding parameters</h4>
<p>
   The step in the encoding procedure where you "choose the
   bit width to use to store the samples" is the crucial
   step that determines how compressed the encoded stream
   will be relative to the original raw data, and how much
   of the audio detail is retained (and how much is lost)
   in the reconstructed signal.
</p>
<p>
   There is no simple algorithm for choosing the bit width.
   This is the subject of a great deal of theoretical and
   practical research in digital audio coding.  Most of the
   mainstream formats define "psycho-acoustic" models based
   on the empirical properties of human audio perception.
   The most important aspect of this is known as "masking",
   which is the tendency of human audio perception to only
   be able to pick out the loudest portion of a complex
   spectrum; louder parts of the spectrum are said to "mask"
   quieter parts.  There are formal mathematical models of
   masking that filter a complex signal to remove inaudible
   portions.
</p>
<p>
   The DCS format itself doesn't impose any constraints
   upon what sort of filtering model is used to construct
   the encoded signal.  The format does constrain how
   much the sample-bit-width parameters can vary from
   frame to frame, since the scaling factor for each
   band is coded into the stream header and is thus global
   to the stream.  1994 Type 1 streams allow for some
   frame-to-frame variability with their additional layer
   of scale coding, but even that's tightly constrained.
</p>
<p>
   For a basic encoder implementation, a simple model
   based on the range of samples per band across the stream
   works reasonably well.  There is one psycho-acoustic
   consideration that seems important even in a simple
   model, which is to prioritize allocating bits to the
   low-frequency bands (the first two or three DCS bands).
   Human hearing models generally hold that the ability
   to distinguish nearby frequencies is keenest in the
   low frequency ranges, below 1000 Hz, and becomes
   increasingly vague with higher frequencies.  This
   makes it possible to use a relatively low bit rate
   in the higher bands without losing much audible
   detail, as long as the first few bands are stored
   at high resolution.  My simple encoder model tries
   to allocate around 8-10 bits per sample in the first
   couple of bands, dropping off to a few bits per
   sample in the top bands.

<h3>Decoding procedure overview</h3>
<p>
   To recover a stream of PCM samples from a DCS stream:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Read bits from the stream and decode them into frequency-domain
   samples, interpreting the input bits according to the stream format type;
   continue until reaching the end of the frame.

   <li>Transform the frame into the time domain (the algorithm
   is discussed below).

   <li>Combine the 16 samples in the overlap buffer with the
   first 16 samples of the frame using the pre-defined overlap mixing
   coefficients, as described in <a href="#Frames">Frames</a> above.

   <li>Output the first 240 samples to the DAC.

   <li>Save the last 16 samples of the new frame into the
   overlap buffer.

   <li>Repeat for the next frame.
</ul>

<h3>Encoding transform (PCM to frequency domain)</h3>
<p>
<p>
   The core of the DCS encoding scheme is a discrete Fourier transform
   (DFT) that converts samples between the time domain (the PCM samples)
   and the frequency domain (the stored frame data).  All versions of
   DCS use the same transform.  The transform can be expressed in
   terms of real numbers as follows:

<p>
   The lower-case-<i>x[n]</i> terms by convention represent the
   collection of <i>N</i> input values, in this case the PCM samples,
   and the capital-<i>X[k]</i> terms represent the transformed
   values.  <i>N</i> is fixed at 256, and <i>k</i> is in the range 0..127.
   There are 256 real-number outputs, even though there are only 128 <i>k</i>'s,
   because of the paired <i>Re</i> and <i>Im</i> elements in the <i>X[k]</i> set.
</p>
<p>
   The notation <i>Re</i> and <i>Im</i> reflects that this is really
   a complex-number DFT in disguise, with the real and imaginary
   components separated, and no square roots of -1 in sight.
   The cosine sums are called the "real part"
   and the sine sum are the "imaginary part".  This is equivalent to
   calculating a complex DFT on the real inputs, and then separating
   the results into their real and imaginary components.  The real
   components form the cosine series, and the imaginary components
   form the sine series.
</p>
<p>
   To encode a frame, compute the DFT of the PCM samples
   for the frame (after applying the window function coefficients to the first
   and last 16 samples of the frame).  Arrange the <i>Re X[k]</i> and <i>Im X[k]</i> outputs
   of the DFT into a 256-element array, in this order:
<pre>
   float frequency_domain_frame[256] = {
       Re_X[0],
       Im_X[0],
       Re_X[1],
       Im_X[1],
       Re_X[2],
       Im_X[2],

       ...

       Re_X[127],
       Im_X[127]
   };
</pre>
<p>
   This array serves as the input to the bit-stream encoding
   procedure.
</p>
<p>
   During decoding, the 256 frequency-domain samples decoded from
   the bit stream are interpreted as an array of <i>Re X[k]</i>
   and <i>Im X[k]</i> in the same order as above, and are used
   as inputs to the inverse DFT.  That yields the reconstructed
   PCM samples, for output to the DAC.
</p>
<p>
   All operations on the samples through the encoding algorithms
   are linear, which means that you can use any scale you like
   to store the sample values.  You can leave
   them in the form of the INT16 values from the PCM inputs,
   for example, or you can rescale them to C++ <b>float</b>
   values between between 0 and 1, say.  It's best to use
   floating-point values instead of integers, though, because
   it's extremely tricky to avoid excessive rounding errors
   when using integers.  Whatever type and scale you use,
   the final values must be converted back to INT16 values
   at the end of the transform process, for input to the
   bit-stream encoding procedure.
</p>

<h4>Encoding transform algorithm 1</h4>
<p>
   The simplest algorithm for performing the encoding transform
   is to compute the sums exactly as shown above.  This is
   inefficient, though, since it requires about 65,000 multiplications.
   The other algorithms listed below are much faster.
</p>

<h4>Encoding transform algorithm 2</h4>
<p>
   The best way to perform a Fourier-like transform is to use a
   Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, which only has to
   perform about 1800 multiplications for a 256-element set.
   The FFT is one of those textbook algorithms that's
   extensively documented and has many good open-source versions
   available, so I'll leave it to the reader to choose an
   implementation.  I personally like the Cooley-Tukey
   iterative in-place algorithm, since it's simple enough
   to code by hand.  But if you prefer
   a ready-to-use library that someone else has already
   tuned and tested, many open-source options are available.
</p>
<p>
   To perform the DCS transform using a library FFT routine or
   a reference algorithm, arrange the 256 PCM samples of the
   frame as the <b>real</b> components of the 256 complex-number
   inputs to your FFT function.  Set all of the imaginary
   components to zero.  Invoke the 256-point complex FFT.
</p>
<p>
   The output from the 256-point FFT consists of 256 complex numbers.
   You only need to keep <b>half</b> of the complex results, because
   the second half of the outputs contains essentially a mirror image
   of the first half, due to symmetries that occur when all of the
   input values are real numbers.  Take the first 128 complex
   outputs, and arrange them into the frame buffer in the
   real/imaginary interleaving order described above
   for the array format.
</p>
<p>
   The outputs must be normalized by dividing each one by 256.
</p>

<h4>Encoding transform algorithm 3</h4>
<p>
   Algorithm 2 above can be improved by taking advantage of the
   all-real-number input set.  Instead of performing a 256-point
   FFT, we can pretend that the PCM inputs are complex numbers
   arranged in real/imaginary pairs, and perform a 128-point
   FFT, which reduces the number of multiplication steps to
   about 900.  This requires an additional step to disentangle
   the results back into the separate sine and cosine sums, but
   that only adds back another 500 multiplies, so ends up
   being a bit quicker on the whole than algorithm 2, at the
   cost of being more complex.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Arrange the PCM samples into complex inputs to the FFT
   as real/complex pairs: so PCM sample [0] and [1] are the
   real and complex part of FFT input [0], PCM samples [2] and [3]
   form FFT input [1], and so on.
   <p>
      Most FFT algorithms take a flat array of inputs arranged in
      exactly this same alternating real/imaginary pair order, so
      in most cases you should be able to just copy the PCM sample
      array straight into the FFT input array without any
      rearrangement.  Check your FFT algorithm/library to make
      sure it works that way.
   </p>

   <li>Run the 128-point complex FFT on this array.  Normalize
   the elements by dividing by 512.

   <li>Extract the values into a separate 256-sample frame buffer
   using the loop below.  Note that this assumes that the FFT outputs
   are arranged in a flat 256-element array in real/imaginary pairs.
   If your FFT algorithm use a different arrangement, such as a
   struct type to represent the complex numbers, simply adjust
   the fft_buf accesses accordingly.

   <pre>
   fft_buf[256] = fft_buf[0];
   fft_buf[257] = fft_buf[1];
   for (int k = 0 ; k &lt; 128 ; ++k)
   {
      float theta = PI * static_cast&lt;float&gt;(k) / 128.0f;
      Ai = -cosf(theta);
      Ar = 1.0f - sinf(theta);
      Bi = -Ai;
      Br = 1.0f + sinf(theta);

      int kr = k*2;       // real component index
      int ki = kr + 1;    // imaginary component index

      frame_buf[k*2] = fft_buf[kr]*Ar[k] - fft_buf[ki]*Ai[k]
        + fft_buf[256-kr]*Br[k] + fft_buf[258-ki]*Bi[k]);

      frame_buf[k*2+1] = fft_buf[ki]*Ar[k] + fft_buf[kr]*Ai[k]
        + fft_buf[256-kr]*Bi[k] - fft_buf[258-ki]*Br[k]);
   }</pre>

   <p>
      The coefficients Ai, Ar, Bi, and Br depend only on the loop
      index, so they can be pre-computed and stored in a static array
      for faster execution.
   </p>

</ul>

<h4>Encoding transform algorithm 4</h4>
<p>
   Our final encoder algorithm represents a step-by-step mirror image
   of the transform algorithm used in the original DCS decoders.  This
   algorithm wrings out a tiny bit of added efficiency by exploiting
   symmetries of the FFT to cut the FFT set size in half, at
   the cost of more post-processing steps and greater complexity.
</p>
<p>
   I personally like algorithm 3 better, since it's pretty efficient
   already, and it's a lot simpler.  I was even tempted to remove
   algorithm 4 from the document, since it's almost ludicrously
   complex, but I decided to leave it for a reason other than its
   modest improvement in efficiency: this is arguably the <i>definitive</i>
   encoder transform algorithm, because it essentially runs the original
   decoders' math formulas backwards.  Math done numerically on a computer never <i>exactly</i>
   matches the underlying closed-form expressions written on paper, because
   the computer version has to work within limited precision and thus
   yields small numerical differences due to accumulated rounding errors in the
   intermediate steps; so to the extent that the algorithms differ
   from the closed-form expressions they purport to implement, this
   is the one that truly represents the inverse of the decoder
   transform.
</p>
<p>
   It's understandable why they went
   to the added trouble in the original decoders: those were running
   on a low-horsepower embedded platform, so they had to use every
   trick they could to make the software run faster.  Modern equipment
   is so much faster that any speed difference between algorithms 3
   and 4 will be negligible.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Working buffers:</b>  The algorithm uses two buffers:
   the PCM <b>input</b> buffer, containing the frame's 256 samples; and a
   <b>258</b>-sample <b>working</b> buffer.  (Note the unusual
   size of the second buffer.)
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Arrange the PCM inputs into the working buffer in the correct
   order as inputs to the Cooley-Tukey iterative in-place FFT
   algorithm.  The algorithm takes <b>complex number</b> inputs;
   treat the PCM samples as real/imaginary component pairs, by
   using PCM samples [0] and [1] as the first real/imaginary pair,
   [2] and [3] as the second, and so on.  Cooley-Tukey requires the
   inputs to be arranged in <b>bit-reversed addressing order</b>.
   
   <li>Apply the Cooley-Tukey algorithm to the buffer.  <b>However</b>, only run
   the algorithm's outer loop for <b>six</b> iterations, instead of the
   usual seven.  (The algorithm normally calls for 7 iterations when
   the set size is 256 elements, as it is here.)

   <li>Perform the following post-processing steps on the <b>working</b> buffer,
   which we refer to below as <b>buf</b>; the element at index <b>n</b> is <b>buf[n]</b>.
   We use the C/C++ convention that the first element is <b>buf[0]</b>.
   <ul>
      <li>Adjust the second half of the buffer to apply odd DFT coefficients:
      <pre>
    for (int j = 1 ; j &lt; 64 ; ++j)
    {
        float theta = -2*PI*static_cast&lt;float&gt;(j)/128.0f;
        float costh = cosf(theta);
        float sinth = sinf(theta);

        int tIdx = 128 + j*2;
        float ar = buf[tIdx];
        float ai = buf[tIdx + 1];

        buf[tIdx] = ar*costh - ai*sinth;
        buf[tIdx+1] = ar*sinth + ai*costh;
    }</pre>
       <p>
          Note that the coefficients depend only on loop index,
          so they can be pre-computed and stored in a static
          const data array for better efficiency.
       </p>

<p>
   The modification we made to the standard Cooley-Tukey
   algorithm - running its outer loop for six iterations rather than
   the standard seven - has the effect of computing <i>two</i> Fourier
   transforms at once.  One transform is applied to the first half
   of the buffer, and the other transform is applied to the second
   half.  It's as though each half of the buffer were an independent
   128-element data set that we want to transform.
</p>
<p>
   This works because Cooley-Tukey is a "divide-and-conquer"
   algorithm.  It partitions the data set into halves, and computes
   the FFT on each half, then combines the halves to figure the FFT
   of the next level up.  The algorithm starts by dividing
   the set into a whole raft of two-element subsets, and doubles
   the size of the partitions on each main loop iteration, until
   it gets to the final iteration, where it combines the two halves
   of the overall set into a single FFT.  By stopping one
   iteration short, we end up with independent FFTs on the
   last two partitions - the halves of the overall set.
</p>
<p>
   As to why we'd want to do this, it's just that it happens to be
   convenient as an intermediate step along the way to the
   real-valued DFT we're really after.  It arranges the data
   in a format that we can operate on with the series of post-processing
   steps to yield the real-valued DFT array.
</p>


<h3>Decoding transform (frequency domain to PCM)</h3>
<p>
   After decoding a frame from the compressed bit stream, the decoder
   must perform the inverse of the encoding transform described above,
   to reconstruct the original time-ordered PCM samples of the audio
   stream from the frequency-domain frame decoded from the bit stream.
</p>
<p>
   The inverse transform algorithm described below assumes the same interpretation
   of the FFT input and output arrays as complex number pairs, where each adjacent
   pair of array elements in the FFT function's input and output buffers represents
   the (real, complex) components of a single complex number.  See above for details.
</p>
<p>
   Note that the working frame buffer must have room for <b>258</b> elements.  This is
   two extra elements, compared to the stored frame data.  The extra elements
   are needed for temporary storage in some of the loop steps.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Using the frame buffer, which we'll call <b>buf</b> in the
   steps below (and we'll refer to element <b>n</b> as <b>buf[n]</b>,
   with elements numbered from [0] as in C/C++):
   <ul>
      <li>Set buf[256] = buf[257] = 0.
      <li>Set buf[128] = -buf[128].

      <li>Fold high/low pairs:

      <pre>
    for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; 128; i += 2)
    {
        float x0 = buf[i];
        float x1 = buf[i + 1];
        float y0 = buf[256 - i];
        float y1 = buf[257 - i];

        buf[i]       = -(x0 + y0);
        buf[i + 1]   = -(x1 - y1);
        buf[256 - i] = -(x0 - y0);
        buf[257 - i] = -(x1 + y1);
    }</pre>

      <li>"Twiddle" the samples:
      <pre>
    for (int i = 0 ; i < 128 ; i += 2)
    {
        float theta = 2.0f*PI*static_cast&lt;float&gt;(128 - i)/256.0f;
        float c0 = cosf(theta);
        float c1 = sinf(theta);

        float x0 = buf[i];
        float x1 = buf[i + 1];
        float xn0 = buf[256 - i];
        float xn1 = buf[257 - i];

        float prod0 = xn1*c1 - xn0*c0;
        float prod1 = xn1*c0 + xn0*c1;

        buf[i]       = x0 + prod1;
        buf[i + 1]   = x1 + prod0 ;

        buf[256 - i] = x0 - prod1;
        buf[257 - i] = prod0 - x1;
    }
</pre>
      <p>
         The coefficients depend only on the loop index, so they can be
         pre-computed and stored in a const static data array.
      </p>

      <li>Fold even/odd sample pairs:
      <pre>
    for (int i = 0 ; i < 128 ; i += 2)
    {
        float x0 = buf[i];
        float x1 = buf[i + 1];
        float y0 = buf[i + 128];
        float y1 = buf[i + 129];

        buf[i]       = x0 + y0;
        buf[i + 1]   = x1 + y1;
        buf[i + 128] = x0 - y0;
        buf[i + 129] = x1 - y1;
    }</pre>
   </ul>

   <li>Apply the Cooley-Tukey <b>Inverse DFT</b> algorithm for 128 complex
   numbers (256 real/imaginary pairs) to the buffer, <b>except</b> run the
   outer loop for <b>six</b> iterations rather than the usual seven.
   (Seven iterations is the usual for a 256-element data set.)  This has
   the effect of performing separate FFTs on the first half and
   second half of the buffer, arranging the results of the first half
   transform in the even-numbered output slots, and the results of the second half
   transform in the odd-numbered output slots (interpreting the "slots" as
   real/imaginary pairs of array entries).
   <p>
      The Cooley-Tukey IDFT algorithm uses bit-reversed addressing.  The
      algorithm here requires that you do the bit-reversed addressing
      reorganization <b>after</b> running the Cooley-Tukey main loop.
      (Some versions of the algorithm do the rearrangement on the input
      end, but in this case it must be done on the output end instead.)
   </p>
   <p>
      Use 1.0 as the IDFT normalization factor.  Note that the normal
      convention for Fourier transforms is to normalize by 1/N (where N
      is the set size) in the inverse transform, so library code might
      make this assumption, but DCS applies the normalization in the
      forward transform instead.
   </p>

</ul>

<p>
   The output from the FFT consists of 256 time-domain
   PCM samples, reconstructing the original raw audio data for
   the frame.  This is ready to mix with the overlap buffer from the
   previous frame, as described in <a href="#Frames">Frames</a>,
   and then to send to the audio DAC for playback.

         These two formats are completely different from one another.
         The Type 1 apparently wasn't much favored, in that it was only used
         in <i>Judge Dredd</i> (even though the <i>IJ</i> software also
         had the same decoder), and only for about 10% of its material,
         and then deleted entirely from the software as of <i>STTNG</i>.
         The balance of streams in <i>JD</i>, and all streams in <i>IJ</i>,

         The 1994 format is a complete overhaul, with almost nothing in
         common with any of the 1993 formats.  The 1994 format had
         excellent staying power: it was used with no further changes in all games
         released in 1994 and later, all the way through the last WPC DCS
         games in 1998.
         <p>
         Note that even though we call this the "1994" format, it's used
         in all of the games released in later years, through 1998.
         We call it "1994" because that's when it first appeared.
         Note also that there's a completely separate but perhaps
         confusingly similar term, "DCS-95", that's the name of
         the new DCS circuit board released in 1995.  That has nothing
         to do with the audio format; it's just the name of the hardware
         platform update.  The 1994 audio format continued
         to be used in all of the games released with the DCS-95
         hardware.

<h4>Detecting the format version</h4>
<p>
   A stream's format version is <b>not</b> encoded anywhere in the
   stream.  DCS was designed purely for use as an embedded system, where
   the audio data set is bundled with the software that reads it.
   The embedded software is just hard-coded to read a particular
   format version; it doesn't have to be told which format version to use,
   since it only knows how to read one format version in the first place.
   If an outside program wants to decode a DCS ROM, though, it's a different story;
   we need to detect which format version the streams are encoded with before
   we can decode them.  There's nothing in the audio
   data that indicates this, unfortunately; the streams all look alike
   at the container level.  The only way to detect the format version
   is to detect which version of the software is embedded in the same ROM.
   They didn't bother to put a string in there anywhere announcing
   "I'm version 1.2.3", so it's not entirely straightforward to
   detect the software version, but it can be done heuristically by examining
   the ADSP-2105 machine code embedded in the ROM, looking for certain
   instruction patterns that are found only in one version or another.  That's
   too complex to describe briefly here; see my DCSDecoder class (in the
   <a href="https://github.com/mjrgh/DCSExplorer" target="_blank">DCS Explorer</a>
   project) for an implementation.
   Another approach is to simply let your user explicitly specify the
   format version when loading the data.  In cases where the data are
   from one of the official releases of a DCS pinball ROM, it's enough
   to know which pinball game the ROM is from; you can use a look-up
   table mapping titles to versions, since every official ROM release
   for a given title used the same DCS software version
   (see <a href="#VersionByTitle">DCS Software Versions by Pinball Title</a>).
</p>
      

<a name="StreamAlignment"></a>
<h3>Stream address alignment requirements</h3>
<p>
   Streams must be stored in ROM such that the first byte of the
   "packed bit stream" portion (i.e., the first byte
   following the stream header) is on an <b>even address offset</b> within
   the ROM.
</p>
<p>
   Since the packed bit stream is always preceded by the frame
   count prefix and stream header, which are always the same size
   for a given stream type, the alignment requirement for
   the packed bit stream implies a corresponding alignment requirement for the
   start of the overall stream (the first byte of the UINT16
   frame count prefix):
</p>
<style type="text/css">
#streamAlignmentTable td:nth-child(2) {
    white-space: nowrap;
}
</style>
<table class="data" id="streamAlignmentTable">
   <tr><th>Format</th><th>Games</th><th>Required Stream Alignment</th></tr>
   <tr>
      <td>1993a Type 1</td>
      <td>
         <i>Indiana Jones<br>
            Judge Dredd</i>
      </td>
      <td>Odd</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>All Others</td>
      <td>All Others</td>
      <td>Even</td>
   </tr>
</table>

<p>
   These requirements follow trivially from the fixed sizes of
   the prefixes: 3 bytes for IJ/JD Type 1 streams
   (the UINT16 frame count plus the 1-byte header),
   and 18 bytes for all other streams (the UINT16 frame count
   plus the 16-byte header).
</p>
<p>
   The stream alignment rule isn't required by anything in
   the DCS format itself.  It's purely an accident of how
   the original ADSP-2105 DCS decoder software was implemented.
   That software reads the packed bit stream using an
   algorithm that only works correctly if the packed bit stream
   starts on an even address within the ROM.  New decoders need
   not enforce the alignment rules, although they're free to
   assume them.  Encoders must observe the alignment requirements if
   they intend to generate ROMs that can be played back with the factory
   software, since the original software will behave unpredictably (usually
   resulting in a CPU reset) if presented with a misaligned stream.
</p>

<h3>Audio sample data format</h3>
<p>
   DCS works in two domains: the PCM sample stream that goes into
   the DAC during playback, and the frequency-domain samples stored
   in the audio bit streams.  In both domains, DCS does everything
   in terms of <b>signed 16-bit integer</b> values.
</p>
<p>
   New implementations are free to use any other numeric representations
   that are more convenient on the local platform, as long as they
   treat the frequency-domain samples at the bit-stream interface
   (i.e., the raw values represented by the codewords stored in the
   bit stream, after adjusting for scaling) as 16-bit signed integers.
   That's the only place where a particular number representation is
   required by the format itself.
</p>


<h3>Common DCS stream structure</h3>

<p>
   All DCS streams have a basic container structure that's common
   to all of the versions and types:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>UINT16 frame count:</b> All streams start with a UINT16
   (in the usual big-endian format) giving the number of DCS frames
   contained in the stream.

   <li><b>Stream header:</b> Immediately following the frame count
   is a stream header, which contains the scaling factor codes for
   the stream's bands.  <i>Almost</i> all stream types use a
   standard 16-byte header.  The sole exception is 1993a Type 1 streams,
   which use a one-byte header.

   <li><b>Packed bit stream:</b> The rest of the object consists
   of a series of varying-bit-length fields, packed together with
   no padding.  Bits are ordered within bytes with the most significant
   bit (bit $80) first.  So: the first bit of the stream is the high-order
   bit of the first byte, the second bit is bit $40 of the first byte,
   and so on until the 8th bit of the stream at bit $01 of the first
   byte.  The ninth bit of the overall stream is the high-order bit
   ($80) of the second byte, and so on.
   <p>
      There truly is no padding anywhere within the packed-bits
      portion of a stream.  Every field, every band, and every frame
      can start and end in the middle of a byte.  This actually
      simplifies things; you just set up a bit-by-bit reader and
      let it run through the stream one bit at a time, and you
      never have to think about skipping bits for alignment
      purposes at any point.
   </p>
</ul>

<h3>Frame count prefix</h3>

<p>
   Every stream starts with a UINT16 frame count prefix.  This is simply
   the number of DCS frames contained in the stream.  During decoding,
   the program knows that it has reached the end of the stream when
   it has finished decoding the number of frames indicated here.
</p>

<a name="StandardStreamHeader"></a>
<h3>Standard stream header</h3>

<p>
   With the exception of the 1993a Type 1 format, every DCS stream
   starts with a 16-byte stream header that encodes information
   global to the stream:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>The stream's major type.  This is encoded in the high bit of the
   first byte of the header.  This allows for two major types in
   each format version, which I designate Type 0 and Type 1, matching
   the value of the header bit that encodes the type.  If the
   high-order bit of the first header byte is zero, I call it a
   Type 0 stream; if the high-order bit is set, I call it a Type 1
   stream.  Note that, other than the name, a Type 0 stream from
   one format version has nothing to do with a Type 0 stream from
   any other version - 1993a Type 0 is a completely separate
   format from 1994 Type 0.

   <li>For 1994 Type 1 streams only, the header encodes the stream's
   "subtype".  This is encoded in the high-order bits of the second and
   third bytes of the header.  Since this is encoded in two bits,
   there are four possible subtypes, which I refer to according to the
   2-bit integer formed by combining the high bit of the
   second byte with the high bit of the third byte: Subtypes 0,
   1, 2, and 3.  Even though the coding allows for four possible
   subtypes, the ADSP-2105 decoders act as though there are only
   two subtypes: Subtype 0, and Subtype "Non-Zero" (i.e., if either
   bit is set, it's treated as signifying "the other subtype, the
   one that's not Subtype 0").  The ADSP-2105 code is written in
   such a way that it was clearly intended to implement four
   distinct subtypes (it even contains the two extra data tables
   they would have used), but it appears that a coding bug accidentally
   folded the treatment of all of the non-zero subtypes into a common
   case. I use the convention that the two surviving distinguishable
   subtypes are named Subtype 0 and Subtype 3, because it's clear
   in the ADSP-2105 decoders that the missing subtypes were meant to
   correspond to the middle two bit patterns in the header bits.

   <li>The scaling factors for the stream's frequency bands.
   DCS divides each frame into a set of frequency bands, which are groups
   of adjacent samples in the frequency-domain frame buffer.
   See <a href="#Bands">below</a>.  The standard header consists of 16 bytes,
   corresponding to 16 frequency bands, and each byte contains
   the scaling factor for the corresponding band.
   <p>
      Each scaling factor is stored in the low-order 6 bits of a
      header byte.  These are stored in a coded format; see
      <a href="#ScalingFactorCodes">Scaling Factor Codes</a> for
      the procedure to convert the codes into multiplication factors.
   </p>

   <li>The sampling density in each band, given by bit $40 of each header byte:
   <ul>
      <li>'0' in bit $40 means <b>all samples</b> in the band are populated
      in every frame in the bit stream
      
      <li>'1' in bit $40 means <b>every other sample</b> of the band is populated
      in the bit stream, and the alternating samples (which aren't encoded at all
      in the bit stream) are implicitly set to zero
   </ul>
   <p>
      When bit $40 is set to '1', the decoder reads half as many samples from
      the bit stream as there are samples in the band, and places them at
      every other position in the working audio buffer's sample slots
      corresponding to the band.  Another way to look at it this: the decoder
      acts as though the alternating samples were all encoded into the bit stream,
      but each one is encoded in the stream as a bit field of width zero, and has
      a value of zero.
   </p>
</ul>

<a name="StreamHeader1993aType1"></a>
<h3>Special stream header for 1993a Type 1 streams</h3>

<p>
   1993a Type 1 streams don't use the standard 16-byte header format
   used for all other stream types.  This header consists of only one byte,
   which encodes the following:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>The stream type, in the high bit ($80) of the header byte, set to '1'
   to indicate a Type 1 stream.

   <li>The number of bands populated per frame in the packed bit stream,
   in the low 5 bits of the header byte.  This value is limited to a maximum
   of $12 (18 decimal).

   <li>A codebook selector, in bits $40 and $20, which specifies how the
   band type codes in the bit stream are coded

<h3>Bands</h3>
<p>
   DCS divides each frequency-domain frame into "bands", which
   are simply groups of adjacent samples.  Each band has a fixed
   size that's pre-defined by the DCS format, as shown below.
   The band sizes are listed in ascending memory order within
   the frame buffer.

<p>
   Note that <b>Samples per band</b> reflects the number of samples the
   band contributes to the frame buffer <b>after</b> decoding.  The
   bit stream might contain a different number of input samples,
   depending on the format.  In some cases, for example, the bit stream
   contains half as many inputs as there are samples in the band.
</p>
<p>
   The purpose of the bands is to group samples that share a common
   set of encoding parameters.  The grouping is a compromise between
   specifying a separate set of parameters for every individual sample,
   which would allow extremely fine-grained parameter selection at
   the cost of a lot of extra storage for all of the parameters, vs.
   using the a single set of parameters across the whole frame, which
   would save storage but wouldn't allow any variability in the
   detail level stored in different parts of the frame.  The "banding"
   approach allows for some degree of parameter variation across the
   frame without storing a huge number of parameters.
</p>
<p>
   The 16 bytes of the standard stream header (used for all stream types
   except 1993a Type 1) correspond directly to the 16 bands defined for
   that stream's format.  The first header byte maps to the first band,
   the second byte maps to the second band, and so on.

<h3>1993a Type 0 Stream Format</h3>

<p>
   This format is identical to <a href="#1993bType01">1993b Type 0</a>.
</p>

<a name="1993aType1"></a>
<h3>1993a Type 1 Stream Format</h3>

<p>
   This format is quite different from all of the others, and apparently
   wasn't much favored.  The only game containing any
   streams at all recorded in this format was <i>Judge Dredd</i>, and even
   that game only used it for a small portion of its material.
   The format's decoder was deleted entirely from the software by
   the time the third DCS pinball title (<i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>) was released.
</p>
<p>
   During encoding, the input to the bit stream encoder is the 256-element array
   of real-valued outputs from the discrete Fourier transform
   (see <a href="#EncodingTransform">Encoding Transform</a>).  Uniquely,
   this format uses all 256 samples as inputs to the bit-stream encoder.
</p>

<img class="ex" src="1993a-type1-bitstream.png">
<div class="caption">
   Figure 7. Schematic of the 1993a Type 1 stream format.
</div>

<p>
   This format is the only one that doesn't use the standard 16-byte
   header.  Instead, it uses a uses a one-byte header, composed of the following
   bit fields:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>(byte &amp; $80) = 0x80, indicating the Type 1 format
   <li>(byte &amp; $1F) = the number of bands encoded for each frame in the bit stream (maximum $12 = 18 decimal)
   <li>(byte &amp; $60) &gt;&gt; 5 = band type codebook selector; see
   <a href="#1993aType1BandTypeCodebooks">1993a Type 1 Band Type Codebooks</a> for the
   contents of codebooks
</ul>

<p>
   Streams of this type must be stored in the ROM starting at an <b>odd</b>
   address (see <a href="#StreamAlignment">Stream Alignment</a>).
</p>
   
<p>
   As with all of the DCS formats, the frame is divided into bands of
   pre-defined sizes.  This format has 18 bands, with the following
   numbers of samples per band:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 10, 12, 14, 18, 22, 28, 24, 24, 24, 26
</div>
<p>
   The band sizes above represent the number of samples in the
   frame buffer <b>after</b> decoding a frame.  The input stream
   in this format codes a <b>pair</b> of samples in every input,
   so there are half as many inputs per band in the bit stream
   as there are frame buffer samples in the band.
</p>
<p>
   During the decoding procedure for each frame, the decoder maintains
   the following state variables:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Previous base scale code</b>, a signed integer variable,
   initialized to <b>$1A</b> at the start of each frame

   <li><b>Working audio buffer output index</b>, initialized to zero
   at the start of each frame, and incremented by one each time a
   decoded sample is added to the audio buffer
</ul>
<p>
   The packed bit stream consists of a series of frames (the number
   of frames is given by the stream's frame count prefix).  Each frame
   consists of a series of bands.  Each band consists of the following
   sequence of values, packed into the stream consecutively as
   bit fields:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The "sample bit width": the number of bits
   used to encode each sample in this band in the input bit stream.
   This field is encoded in a Huffman-like code, using
   the pre-defined codebook selected by bits $60 from the header.
   (In other words, you look at bits $60 in the header byte to determine
   which of the four pre-defined codebooks to use, then you read bits
   from the stream and match them against the selected codebook to
   look up the corresponding plaintext value.  The plaintext value that
   you read out of the codebook tells you the bit width of the samples
   packed into the bit stream a little further downstream.)  See
   <a href="#1993aType1BandTypeCodebooks">1993a Type 1 Band Type Codebooks</a>.
   <p>
      There are two special values for this field (of the plaintext
      result obtained from the codebook) that change the
      interpretation of the rest of the band and/or frame contents
      in the packed bit stream:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li><b>$0000</b> means that the samples are encoded with zero bits
      and all have the value zero.  The scale code is omitted in this case
      (since there's no need to apply a scaling factor to zero),
      and there no bits for the samples, so the net result is that there
      are no more bits at all in the stream for this band.  The next bit
      in the stream is the first bit of the next band.

      <li><b>$FFFF</b> means that the entire frame ends here, regardless
      of the band count in the stream header.  The next bit of the input
      stream is the first bit of the next frame.
   </ul>
   
   <li>A "scale code" for the samples in the band.  This is encoded with
   another pre-defined Huffman-type code (different from the one used for
   the sample bit width field); see
   <a href="#1993aType1ScaleCodeCodebook">1993a Type 1 Scale Code Codebook</a>.
   This field is not present if the sample bit width is zero.
   <p>
      The value obtained from the codebook is a delta value (i.e., a
      difference from the previous base value) with a rolling window
      for the result.  To obtain the new scale code,
      calculate:
   </p>
   <pre>
   new scale code = (previous base scale code) + (value from codebook) + 2*(bit width) - 1
   if (new scale code > $39)
       new scale code = new scale code - $36</pre>
   <p>
      where <b>bit width</b> is the sample bit width read in the first
      step above, and <b>previous base scale code</b> is an integer variable
      that the decoder maintains from band to band, initialized to <b>$1A</b>
      at the start of each new frame.   After calculating the new scale code,
      update <b>previous base scale code</b> to:
   </p>
   <pre>
   previous base scale code = (new scale code) - 2*(bit width)</pre>
   <p>
      The scale code consists of two bit fields: the low-order two bits are
      the <b>exponent</b>, and the high-order 14 bits are the <b>left-shift</b>.
      The scaling factor is effectively calculated as:
   </p>
   <pre>
   <tt>scaling factor = pow(0.8108, exponent) * pow(2, left-shift)</tt></pre>
   <p>
      where <tt>pow(a,b)</tt> represents raising <b>a</b> to the power of <b>b</b>.
      The original ADSP-2105 implementation uses fixed-point integer arithmetic
      to perform the equivalent calculation.
      
      
   
   <li>The remainder of the bit stream for this band consists of the
   the sample inputs.  There's one sample input in the bit stream one per
   <b>pair of band elements</b>.
   Each sample in the bit stream represents <b>two</b> samples in the decoded frame,
   so there are half as many samples as band elements.  Each sample
   in the bit stream is coded as an unsigned N-bit integer, where N is
   the bit width read above.  This is an index into yet another lookup table:
   see <a href="#1993aType1SamplePairTable">1993a Type 1 Sample Pair Look-up Table</a>.
   This table contains two sample values for each input.  To look up the
   entry pair for a given sample input, calculate the array index as:
   <pre>
   array index = (2 &lt;&lt; (bit width)) + 2*(sample input value)</pre>
   <p>
      Use that to index the pair look-up table, and read the entry at
      that index and the entry at the next index (index + 1).  Multiply
      each value found there by the scaling factor calculated in the previous
      step <b>and</b> by the "mixing level factor".  Add the two result
      values into the working audio buffer at the next two consecutive
      positions.  (Literally <b>add</b> the new values to the existing values
      already in the corresponding buffer slots: the channels are combined into the output
      buffer simply by adding up the contributions from all channels.)
   </p>
</ul>

<a name="1993bType01"></a>
<h3>1993b Type 0/Type 1 Stream Format</h3>

<p>
   The 1993b Type 0 and Type 1 formats are similar enough to one another that they can be
   fairly easily combined into a common encode or decoder implementation,
   which only has to use different handling at a few key points in the
   stream processing.  Furthermore, the <a href="#1993aType0">1993a Type 0 format</a>
   is identical to 1993b Type 0, so a combined handler will automatically
   work with 1993a Type 0 as well as the two 1993b types.
</p>
<p>
   During encoding, the input to the bit-stream encoder consists of
   <b>255</b> of the 256 elements from the output of the discrete Fourier
   transform step that's common to all encodings (see
   <a href="#EncodingTransform">Encoding Transform</a>):
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Copy element [0] in the DFT array to element [1] in the array (overwriting element [1])
   <li>Use the 255-element subset of the array from element [1] through [255] as the encoder inputs
</ul>

<img class="ex" src="1993b-bitstream.png">
<div class="caption">
   Figure 8. Schematic of the 1993b Type 0/1 stream formats.
</div>
<p>
   The 1993b Type 0 and 1 formats use the <a href="#StandardStreamHeader">standard 16-byte stream header</a>.
   These streams must be stored in the ROM starting at an <b>even</b>
   address (see <a href="#StreamAlignment">Stream Alignment</a>).
</p>
<p>
   As usual, bit $80 of the first byte of the header indicates the stream's
   major type.  If bit $80 is cleared (zero), it's a Type 0 stream; if the
   bit is set, it's a Type 1 stream.
</p>
<p>
   Apart from the special type bit in the first byte, the bytes of
   the stream header specify the <b>scaling factor codes</b> for the stream's
   bands.  The first header byte whose low-order 7 bits are set to $7F marks
   the end of the populated bands; if no such marker is present,
   all 16 bands are populated.  Each header byte also uses bit $40 to
   specify the <b>sample density</b>: if bit $40 is zero, all samples
   in each band are populated in the bit stream, otherwise half of the
   samples are populated in the bit stream, and the remaining samples
   per band are implicitly all zero.
</p>
<p>
   Following the stream header, the bit stream consists of a series of frames, in playback time order.
   Each frame contains a series of bands, in order of the working audio buffer
   placement.   For each band, the number of samples encoded in the bit stream and the number of working
   audio buffer slots depends upon the stream type, band number, and sampling density code in the
   stream header (bit $40 of the stream header byte corresponding to the band).  In the table
   below, band #0 is the first band in the frame, and the subsequent bands in the frame
   are numbered 1 through 15.

</table>
<p>
   Explanations of the table columns:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Bit-stream samples</b> is the number of samples coded in the
   bit-stream.  When the Band Type Code is 0, the samples aren't actually
   present in the bit stream, but the same number of samples should be
   considered <i>implicitly</i> present, all with the value 0,
   taking up no bits in the stream.  You can think of the samples as being
   present in the bit-stream in a ghostly way: each one takes zero bits
   to encode, so we know they're really there, they just don't take up
   any space.
   
   <li><b>Audio buffer increment</b> is the number of slots to advance the
   <b>working audio buffer output index</b> for each stream sample.  This is
   always 1 when the sample density bit in the stream header byte for the
   band is $00 (every sample in the band is populated in the bit stream),
   and is always 2 when the sample density bit is $40 (every other sample is
   populated in the bit stream).

   <li><b>Band Type Code 0 Sub-Type 0 skip</b> is the number of slots to advance the
   <b>working audio buffer output index</b> in the special case where the
   Band Type Code is 0 (meaning all samples for the band are implicitly
   zero and are not stored in the bit stream) <b>and</b> the Band Sub-Type is 0.
   In this case <b>only</b>, the output index is incremented by the <b>skip</b>
   value.  This value isn't used in any other case;
   in every other case, the index advances by the <b>audio buffer increment</b>
   times the number of bit-stream samples.

   <li><b>Audio buffer placement</b> specifies how the working audio buffer
   samples correspond to the samples in the bit stream:
   <ul>
      <li><b>All</b> means that there's a 1:1 correspondence, which is
      always the case when the sample density bit is $00 (signifying that
      all samples are populated in the bit stream).
      
      <li><b>Even</b> means that the bit-stream samples are placed at every
      other slot in the audio buffer starting at the current <b>working audio buffer output index</b>
      as it's found at the start of the band.
      
      <li><b>Odd</b> means that the bit-stream samples are placed at every
      other slot in the audio buffer starting at the <b>next slot after</b> the
      current  <b>working audio buffer output index</b> as it's found at the
      start of the band.  In other words, increment the index first, and then
      start placing samples at every other slot.
   </ul>
</ul>
<p>
   There are two peculiar cases in the table worth calling out for extra
   attention, because they contradict the evident patterns that otherwise 
   inform the design.  These are arguably bugs in the ADSP-2105 decoders,
   given their blatant inconsistency with the rest of the design, but
   whether intentional or not, they're de facto features of the format
   that new encoders and decoders must implement the same way to be compatible
   with the existing ROMs.  My guess is that these cases represent bugs that
   were deliberately included in the decoder to compensate for corresponding
   bugs in the encoder that were never resolved, or perhaps it was the other way
   around.  Or maybe the software was developed incrementally from the
   prototype stages, as a lot of commercial software is, and 
   accumulated these inconsistencies over time as coders added new code
   without thinking too much about what was already there.  Whatever
   the reasons, these oddities are permanent features of the format:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>For Type 0 streams with half sampling density (header byte bit $40 is set),
   the bit stream contains 16 samples, which correspond to 32 samples in the output
   buffer, placed at odd offsets from the start of the band.  This is unusual in that
   the 16 samples in the bit stream correspond to <b>two</b> bands worth of data
   (32 sample slots) in the audio buffer.

   <li>For Type 1 streams with half sampling density, the <b>Band Type Code 0 Sub-Type 0 skip</b>
   distance is set to 8, even though there are 8 input samples and the <b>increment</b>
   is 2, which would normally imply that 16 audio buffer slots are skipped.  And
   indeed they are, in every case except one: when the Band Type Code is 0 <b>and</b> the Band Sub-Type is 0,
   the decoder advances the buffer index by the <b>skip</b> value.  In every other case,
   it stores 8 samples at every other position (because the <b>increment</b> is 2),
   which has the effect of advancing the buffer index by 16 positions.

</ul>

<p>
   An encoder or decoder must maintain the following state while working
   on the bit stream:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Previous band type codes,</b> a 16-element byte array,
   initialized at the beginning of the stream to all zeros.  This is zeroed
   only at the beginning of the entire stream, and after that carries
   forward across frames.  <b>Don't</b> re-zero it at the start of a frame.

   <li><b>Previous input</b>, a UINT16 variable, set to zero at the
   start of each frame

   <li><b>Previous delta</b>, a UINT16 variable, set to zero at the
   start of each frame

   <li><b>Band Sub-Type</b>, an integer variable, set at the start of
   each frame to:
   <ul>
      <li><b>2</b> for a Type 0 stream
      <li><b>0</b> for a Type 1 stream
   </ul>

   <li><b>Current band type code</b>, set to zero at the start of each frame

   <li><b>Working audio buffer output index</b>, set to the index of
   the <b>second</b> buffer element (<b>1</b> in a C program) at the start of each frame;
   this is used to determine the buffer location of each new sample in the frame, and
   is incremented after storing each sample

   <li><b>Original second sample</b>, set to the value of the second element (array index 1,
   in a C program) of the working audio buffer at the start of each new frame
</ul>

<p>
   Each band's bit-stream data block is arranged as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Zero-width flag:</b>  This applies <b>only</b> for the second and
   subsequent bands in a frame, and <b>only</b> when the previous band of
   the same frame uses Band Type Code 0.  If both of these conditions are true, then
   the bit stream contains a one-bit flag indicating whether or not the
   new band also uses Band Type Code 0:
   <ul>
      <li>If the bit is '0', the new band uses a <b>new</b> band type code,
      specified in the next stream bits.

      <li>If the bit is '1', the new band repeats Band Type code 0, and
      the Zero-width flag bit is the last (and only) bit in the bit stream
      for the new band.   The next bit in the bit stream is the first bit of
      the next band.
      <p>
         <b>Don't</b> update the <b>Previous band type codes</b> array
         for the band when the bit is '1'.  This frame doesn't count against
         the next differential update.
      </p>
   </ul>
   <p>
      This coding provides an extremely compact representation for frames that
      are mostly empty: it only requires a single bit to encode a
      band that contains all zero sample values.
   </p>
   <p>
      The zero-width flag is <b>not present in the bit stream</b> when either
      of the conditions above is not met: it's not present in the first
      band of a new frame, and it's not present after a band using a
      non-zero band type code.  In these cases, the band's first bit-stream
      element is the Band Type Code section, below.
   </p>

   <li><b>Band Type Code:</b>  If the rest of the band wasn't already marked
   as empty by a Zero-width flag, then the next bits in the stream specify the new band's
   Band Type Code, which specifies how the sample inputs for the band are stored
   in the bit stream.  This is coded differently for Type 0 and Type 1 streams:
   <ul>
      <li>For a Type 0 stream:
      <ul>
         <li>The next bit specifies whether or not the Band Sub-Type is
         changing for this band, relative to the previous band of the same
         frame:
         <ul>
            <li>If the bit is '0', the new band has the same Sub-Type as
            the prior band

            <li>If the bit is '1', it's followed by another single
            bit specifying the new Sub-Type
            <ul>
               <li>If the next bit is '0', subtract 1 from the current
               value of the <b>Band Sub-Type</b> variable; if the result is less than
               0, set it to 2
               
               <li>If the next bit is '1', add 1 to the current value of the
               <b>Band Sub-Type</b> variable; if the result is greater than 2, set it to 0
            </ul>
         </ul>

         <li>The next 4 bits form an unsigned integer value, 0-15, which
         directly gives the new Band Type Code.
      </ul>

      <li>For a Type 1 stream:  The next bits encode the new Band Type Code as
      a difference from the Band Type Code of the <b>same band in the previous frame</b>,
      using a Huffman-type varying-bit-length coding.  See
      <a href="#1993bType1BandTypeCodebooks">1993b Type 1 Band Type Codebook</a> for
      details on the coding.
      <p>
         The codebook will give you a signed integer value, -16 to +15.  Add this
         value to the <b>Previous band type codes</b> array element corresponding
         to the current band number; this yields the new Band Type Code for the
         current band.  Store this value back in the <b>Previous band type codes</b>
         array to carry it forward to the next frame, which will use the same
         differential encoding to store its own Band Type Code.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Huffman-coded bit string also updates the Band Sub-Type.  Each codebook
         entry contains a "flip the sub-type" flag in addition to the differential
         Band Type Code value.  If this flag is set in the matched codebook entry,
         change the value of the <b>Band Sub-Type</b> variable from 0 to 1 or from
         1 to 0.  (Type 1 streams can only use these two band sub-types - they can't
         ever use sub-type 2.)  If the
         flag isn't set, simply leave the <b>Band Sub-Type</b> variable as it is;
         the new band uses the same sub-type as the prior band.
      </p>
      <p>
         Note the inconsistency between the reference points for the differential
         Band Type code and the Sub-Type.  The Band Type Code is stored differentially
         frame-to-frame, whereas the Sub-Type is stored differentially band-to-band within
         the same frame.
      </p>
      
   </ul>

   <li><b>Samples:</b>  For all Band Type Code values except 0, the next bits of the
   bit stream encode the sample inputs.  See the table above for the number of
   samples coded in the stream.
   <p>
      The samples are stored in the bit stream as simple signed N-bit integer values,
      where:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>For Type 0 streams, N = the Band Type Code + 1
      <li>For Type 1 streams, N = the Band Type Code
   </ul>
   <p>
      If the Band Type Code is 0, the samples all have the value 0, and none
      of them are actually stored in the bit stream.  Or, put another way,
      they're all stored with zero bits apiece.  Either way you look at it,
      the bit stream contains nothing more for the current band in this case.
      The next bit in the stream is the first bit of the next  band.  This band
      still has the implied zero-value inputs, though, which will be needed in
      the next step.
   </p>
   <p>
      For non-zero Band Type codes, the values are stored as signed integers
      in 2's-complement notation.  The first bit of each sample is interpreted
      as the sign bit, so when reading an N-bit integer from the bit stream into
      a wider native variable type, you must "sign-extend" the value to
      fill all of the higher-order bits of the native variable with '0' or
      '1' bits matching the first bit of the value encoded in the stream.
   </p>

   <li><b>Interpreting the samples:</b>  The inputs from the previous step must
   now be interpreted as INT16 sample values and mixed into the working audio
   buffer.  This is where the <b>Band Sub-Type</b> comes in:

   <ul>
      <li><b>Band Sub-Type 0:</b>  The stream samples are stored as independent
      values.  To store, multiply each input by the band's <a href="#ScalingFactorCodes">scaling factor</a>
      and the <a href="#MixingMultiplier">mixing level multiplier</a> for the channel
      where the stream is playing.  Add the result to the value already in the working
      audio buffer at the current output index.

      <p>
         As a special case, when the Band Type Code is 0 and the Band Sub-Type is 0,
         don't do anything to the output buffer.  Instead, just advance the
         current output index by the <b>Band Type Code 0 Sub-Type 0 skip</b>
         from the table above.
      </p>
      
      <li><b>Band Sub-Type 1:</b>  The stream samples are stored as <b>deltas from the
      previous sample values</b>.  Add the input to the <b>Previous Input</b> variable to get
      the new sample value, then multiply the result by the <a href="#ScalingFactorCodes">scaling factor</a> and the
      <a href="#MixingMultiplier">mixing level multiplier</a>, and add it to the value already in the working audio
      buffer at the current output index.
      
      <li><b>Band Sub-Type 2:</b> The stream samples are stored as <b>deltas from the previous deltas</b>.
      Add the input to the <b>Previous Input Delta</b> variable, then add the
      result to the <b>Previous Input</b> variable, yielding the new input.
      Multiply the result by the <a href="#ScalingFactorCodes">scaling factor</a>
      and the <a href="#MixingMultiplier">mixing level multiplier</a> and
      add it into the working audio buffer at the current output index.
      
   </ul>
   <p>
      After processing each input, store the raw bit-stream value (before any of the scaling
      and adding steps) in the <b>Previous input</b> variable, and store the
      difference between this input and the previous input in the <b>Previous delta</b>
      variable.  This is necessary to carry the values over to the next input and
      next band if it uses Sub-Type 1 or 2.  Increment the working audio buffer
      output index by the <b>Audio buffer increment</b> value from the table earlier
      in this section.
   </p>
</ul>

<p>
   After processing all of the bands in the current frame, there's a final step required.
   Calculate the difference between the working audio buffer's <b>second</b>
   element (at index 1 in a C program) and the <b>Original second sample</b> variable stored
   at the beginning of the frame, and add the result to the working audio
   buffer's <b>first</b> (at index 0 in a C program).  Set the second buffer
   element back to the <b>Original second sample</b> value.  The effect is
   simply to move the new frame's contribution to buffer element [1] into
   buffer element [0] instead.

<h3>1994 Type 0/Type 1 Stream Format</h3>
<p>
   The 1994 format defines two stream types, Type 0 and Type 1, selected by
   the high bit of the first header byte as usual.  The two types are very
   similar to one another; they use an identical bit stream format, and vary
   only in how some of the fields are interpreted.
</p>
<p>
   During encoding, the input to the bit-stream encoder consists of
   <b>255</b> of the 256 elements from the output of the
   (see <a href="#EncodingTransform">Encoding Transform</a>):
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Copy element [0] in the DFT array to element [1] in the array (overwriting element [1])
   <li>Use the 255-element subset of the array from element [1] through [255] as the encoder inputs
</ul>
<img class="ex" src="1994-bitstream.png">
<div class="caption">
   Figure 9. Schematic of the 1993b Type 0/1 stream formats.
</div>

<p>
   These formats use the <a href="#StandardStreamHeader">standard stream header</a>.
   Streams of this type must be stored in the ROM starting at an <b>even</b>
   address (see <a href="#StreamAlignment">Stream Alignment</a>).
</p>
<p>
   As usual, bit $80 of the first byte of the header indicates the stream's
   major type.  If bit $80 is cleared (zero), it's a Type 0 stream; if the
   bit is set, it's a Type 1 stream.
</p>
<p>
   For 1994 Type 1 streams only, the stream header also encodes a
   Stream Subtype.  This is encoded in the second and third
   stream header bytes, also in bit $80 of each byte.
</p>
<table class="data">
   <tr><th>Second header byte bit $80</th><th>Third header byte bit $80</th><th>Stream Subtype</th></tr>
   <tr><td>$00</td><td>$00</td><td>Subtype 0</td></tr>
   <tr><td>$00</td><td>$80</td><td>Subtype 3</td></tr>
   <tr><td>$80</td><td>$00</td><td>Subtype 3</td></tr>
   <tr><td>$80</td><td>$80</td><td>Subtype 3</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
   Put more simply, if the high bits of both the second and third header bytes are
   cleared (zero), the stream uses Subtype 0; otherwise it uses Subtype 3.
</p>
<p>
   Apart from the special type-flag bits in the first three bytes, the bytes of
   the stream header specify the <b>scaling factor codes</b> for the stream's
   bands.  The first header byte whose low-order 7 bits are set to $7F marks
   the end of the populated bands; if no such marker is present,
   all 16 bands are populated.  Each header byte also uses bit $40 to
   specify the <b>sample density</b>: if bit $40 is zero, all samples
   in each band are populated in the bit stream, otherwise half of the
   samples are populated in the bit stream, and the remaining samples
   per band are implicitly all zero.
</p>
   
   
<p>
   After the stream header, the bit stream consists of a series of frames,
   in playback time order.  Each frame consists of a <b>frame header</b>,
   which specifies the layout of the bands in the frame, followed by
   the samples for each band, in order of the bands within the working
   audio buffer.
</p>
<p>
   The bands for the 1994 formats are groups of adjacent samples in the
   audio buffer, with the following band sizes (measured in the number
   of samples in the band), in audio buffer order:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   7, 8, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 32
</div>

<p>
   An encoder or decoder must maintain the following state while working
   on the bit stream:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Previous band type codes,</b> a 16-element byte array,
   initialized at the beginning of the stream to all zeros.  This is zeroed
   only at the beginning of the entire stream, and after that carries
   forward across frames.  <b>Don't</b> re-zero it at the start of a frame.

   <li><b>Working audio buffer output index</b>, set to the index of
   the <b>second</b> buffer element (<b>1</b> in a C program) at the start of each frame;
   this is used to determine the buffer location of each new sample in the frame, and
   is incremented after storing each sample

   <li><b>Original second sample</b>, set to the value of the second element (array index 1,
   in a C program) of the working audio buffer at the start of each new frame
</ul>

<p>
   Each frame's bit-stream data block is arranged as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Frame header:</b>  Each frame starts with a frame header, consisting
   of one element per populated band.  The number of populated bands
   is given by the stream header: the first header byte whose low-order
   7 bits are set to $7F marks the end of the header, so the number of
   populated bands is the number of header bytes <i>before</i> the
   end marker.  If there's no end marker, all 16 bands are populated.

   <p>
      Before you read the frame header, create a 16-element array called
      <b>initial band type codes</b>, and copy the current entries from the
      <b>previous band type code</b> array into the <b>initial</b> array.
   </p>
   <p>
      Each frame header element gives the Band Type code for the corresponding
      band.  That is, the first element of the frame header gives the Band Type
      code for the first band in the frame, the second element gives the code
      for the second band, and so on for each populated band.  The type code is
      encoded differentially using a Huffman-type varying-bit-length code,
      with the pre-defined codebook listed under <a href="#1994BandTypeCodebooks">1994 Band Type codebook</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
      The codebook entries are differential: to obtain the new Band Type code
      for the new frame, read bits from the bit-stream, look up the bits in the
      codebook, and add the plaintext value obtained from the codebook to the
      <b>previous band type code</b> array entry for the band.  Note that you
      must actually <b>update</b> the array entry at this point, because the
      new value will be the reference point for the <b>next</b> frame.
   </p>
   <p>
      The interpretation of the Band Type code (the updated value of the band's
      array entry) depends upon the stream type:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li><b>Type 0 streams:</b> The Band Type code is given directly by the frame header entry

      <li><b>Type 1 streams:</b> The value obtained from the frame header is an index into
      a lookup table, which yields the Band Type code to use for the
      band.  The lookup tables are pre-defined; see
      <a href="#1994Type1BnadXlat">1994 Type 1 Band Type Code Lookup Tables</a>.
      <p>
         To use these tables, first choose the
         array corresponding to the current band number, then use the value
         decoded from the frame header (i.e., after obtaining the Huffman
         table plaintext and adding it to the band type code from the previous
         frame) as an index into the selected array.  The entry there gives
         the final Band Type code to use for the band, as well as an adjustment
         that must be added to the band's scaling factor code obtained from the stream
         header.
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Don't</b> update the <b>previous band type code</b> array with the
         translated band type code.  The <b>previous</b> array stores the
         pre-translated value only.  The translated value is only for use
         in the current frame, for interpreting the samples stored in the
         corresponding band.
      </p>
   </ul>

   <li><b>Scaling factors:</b>  The scaling factors for the bands aren't
   encoded directly into the bit stream; they come from the stream
   header.  Each byte of the stream header gives the scaling factor code
   for the corresponding band; the scale factor code is stored in the low-order
   6 bits of the header byte.  The scaling factor codes from the stream
   header must be further adjusted in each frame as follows.  Note that
   these adjustments are to the scaling factor <b>code</b>, prior to
   translating the code into a multiplication factor.
   <ul>
      <li><b>For Type 0 streams:</b>  No adjustment.
      The scaling factor codes from the stream header are used directly in
      every frame, with no changes.

      <li><b>For Type 1 streams:</b>  The scaling factor code from the stream
      header for each band must be adjusted in every frame, by adding the
      scaling factor adjustment value found in the Band Type Code lookup
      table (described above) to the original value from the stream header.
      This adjustment is per-frame; it doesn't carry over from frame to
      frame.  In each frame, start with the scaling factor code for the band
      as stored in the stream header, and add the adjustment value from the
      Band Type translation lookup table.

      <p>
         For <b>band numbers 0 through 2 only</b> in <b>Type 1 streams only</b>,
         there's an additional
         adjustment that depends upon the Stream Subtype (obtained from
         bits $80 of the second and third stream header bytes) <b>and</b>
         the Band Type Code of the corresponding band in the <b>previous frame</b>.
         We need another set of pre-defined tables for this, one for
         Subtype 0 and another for Subtype 3.  See
         <a href="#1994Type1ScaleAdjustments">1994 Type 1 Stream Scale Factor Code Adjustment Tables</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         First, choose the table that corresponds to the stream's
         Subtype.  Use the current band number as an index into the <b>initial band type codes</b> array
         (created above, before reading the new frame header), and use the value you read from that
         array as an index into the adjustment table.  Add the number from the
         adjustment table to the scaling factor code for the band.
         This adjustment is <b>in addition to</b> the adjustment from the
         Band Type Code lookup table, and again, it only applies to the
         first three bands of each frame, band numbers 0-2.
      </p>
   </ul>
   

   <li><b>Bands:</b> The frame header is followed in the bit-stream by the
   band data.  Each band is simply a list of the band's samples, in audio
   buffer order, encoded using a format that depends upon the Band Type code
   obtained from the frame header (<b>after</b> the lookup table translation
   step, if this is a Type 1 stream).
   <p>
      If the band's sample density flag in the stream header is set to
      "half density" (that is, bit $40 of the stream header byte corresponding
      to the band number is set to '1'), there are half as many samples in the
      bit stream as there are audio buffer slots for the band.  Otherwise,
      there's one sample in the bit stream for each audio buffer slot for
      the band.
   </p>
   <p>
      To read the samples from the band, use the Band Type Code obtained
      from the frame header, after applying the lookup table translation
      for a Type 1 stream, to determine the sample format:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li><b>Band Type Code 0:</b>  The samples are all zero values,
      encoded without any bits in the stream.  There's nothing more to
      read for this band; the next bit in the stream is the first bit
      of the next band.

      <li><b>Band Type Code 1 through 6:</b>  The samples are stored
      with a Huffman-type varying-bit-length code, using a pre-defined
      codebook corresponding to the Band Type code.  There are six
      separate codebooks, one per Band Type code in this range.
      See <a href="#1994SampleCodebooks">1994 sample-value codebooks</a>
      for the codebook contents.

      <li><b>Band Type Code 7 through 15:</b> The samples are encoded
      as simple signed 2's-complement integer values, with the Band Type Code
      giving the number of bits per sample.  For example, Band Type Code 8 signifies
      that the samples are encoded as 8-bit signed integers.  With 2's-complement
      notation, the first bit of each sample is interpreted as
      the sign bit.  When reading an N-bit integer from the bit stream into
      a wider native variable type, you must "sign-extend" the value to
      fill all of the higher-order bits of the native variable with '0' or
      '1' bits matching the first bit of the value encoded in the stream.
   </ul>

</ul>

<p>
   <b>Interpreting the samples:</b>  After reading the samples from the
   bit stream, they must be converted into audio buffer samples by
   multiplying each sample by the band's <a href="#ScalingFactorCodes">scaling factor</a>
   and by the <a href="#MixingMultiplier">mixing level multiplier</a> for the
   channel where the stream is playing.  Then simply add the result into the audio buffer, and advance
   the audio buffer output index by one or two positions, depending upon the
   sampling density for the band.  (Increment by one position for normal bands,
   or two positions for half-density bands, where the bit stream only contains
   half as many samples as the band's audio buffer span.)
</p>

<p>
   After processing all of the bands in the current frame, there's a final step required.
   Calculate the difference between the working audio buffer's <b>second</b>
   element (at index 1 in a C program) and the <b>Original second sample</b> variable stored
   at the beginning of the frame, and add the result to the working audio
   buffer's <b>first</b> (at index 0 in a C program).  Set the second buffer
   element back to the <b>Original second sample</b> value.  The effect is
   simply to move the new frame's contribution to buffer element [1] into
   buffer element [0] instead.
</p>
   

<a name="Mixer"></a>
<h2>Channel mixer</h2>

<p>
   DCS maintains a number of independent volume and mixing level
   settings, which are combined to determine the relative
   loudness contribution of each channel to the final mix, and
   the final overall loudness.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Master volume level: This is a single global value across
   all channels, $00 to $FF, set by the host via the $55AA
   <a href="#SpecialCommands">special command codes</a>.  The
   WPC user interface displays the volume level on a scale
   from 0 to 31 when using the coin door buttons to adjust
   the level; the corresponding DCS master volume setting
   is the displayed value times 8.

   <li>Host-controlled per-channel volume: Each channel also has a
   separate host-controlled volume level setting, $00 to $FF, that
   applies just to the single channel.  This is controlled by the
   host via the $55AB series of <a href="#SpecialCommands">special command codes</a>.
   I don't think that any of the WPC games ever send this
   command, so this parameter probably never changes from
   the power-on default level of $FF.  This
   adjustment doesn't exist in the original 1993 software
   released with <i>Indiana Jones</i> and <i>Judge Dredd</i>.

   <li>Cross-channel adjustments:  Each channel has an array
   of adjustment levels applied to it by <i>each other channel</i>
   (including itself) via opcodes $07-$0C.  These are values from
   -8191 to +8191, which are computed from the INT8 operands
   specified in opcodes $07-$0C by multiplying by $40 (equivalent
   to shifting left by 6 bits).   The cross-channel adjustments
   allow one channel's track program to adjust the level of another
   channel, without having to coordinate with the other channel
   program directly; for example, a foreground effect can temporarily
   reduce the main music track's volume to make the effect stand out
   better.  Since each channel keeps an array of every other channel's
   separate contribution to its adjustment level, there's no conflict if
   several channels all make simultaneous adjustments on another
   channel.
</ul>

<h3>Defaults</h3>
<p>
   The master volume is set to $67 at CPU reset.  (This corresponds
   to a value of about 12 on the 0-31 scale displayed on the DMD
   during manual adjustment via the coin door buttons.)  The DCS
   board doesn't have any non-volatile storage, so it can't save
   and restore its volume settings across power cycles or even
   soft CPU resets; it counts on  the WPC host to handle non-volatile
   storage of the user's master volume level setting, and to explicitly
   send it to the sound board again after every sound board reset.
   The WPC host communicates the level setting to the sound board
   via the $55AA <a href="#SpecialCommands">special command</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The CPU reset default for the channel volume level is set
   to $FF for all channels.  These settings are only affected
   after reset by the $55AB series of special commands.
</p>
<p>
   All elements of the the cross-channel adjustments array for a
   given channel are reset to 0 at CPU reset and every time
   n a new track program is loaded.
</p>
   
<h3>Fades</h3>
<p>
   The cross-channel adjustment levels can include fades, meaning
   gradual adjustments made over time.  These are updated on each
   main loop pass.  Each fade is specified as a target level and
   per-frame delta; on each frame, the delta (which may be negative)
   is added to the current level, until the current level reaches
   or passes the target level, at which point the current level
   is clamped to the target level and the fade is terminated.
</p>

<a name="MixingMultiplier"></a>
<h3>Mixing multiplier factor</h3>
<p>
   The relative contribution of each channel to the overall mix
   is determined by a "mixing multiplier" that the main loop
   calculates on each frame from the per-channel volume and the
   cross-channel adjustments.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Add together all of the cross-channel adjustment levels,
   limiting the sum to the range -8191..+8191.

   <li>Divide the result by $40, then add $80, and interpret
   the result as an unsigned 8-bit integer.   This will linearly
   map the -8191..+8191 range we were working with above to $00..$FF.

   <li>Calculate <tt>pow(0.9733, 255 - x)</tt>, where <tt>x</tt>
   is the 8-bit value calculated above and <tt>pow(a,b)</tt> means
   "raise a to the b power", a<sup>b</sup>.  (The ADSP-2105 software
   performs the equivalent calculation using <a href="#MixingLevelMultiplierInts">integer arithmetic</a>,
   treating the intermediate values as fixed-point fractions.)
   Note that this calculation converts from the linear -127..127
   scale used in the opcode $07-$0C operand bytes to a logarithmic
   scale, to better match human perception of audio loudness scaling.

   <li>Take the host-controlled per-channel volume level and shift
   it left by 8 bits.  (The first 1993 software, which doesn't have
   this adjustment, uses a fixed value of $FFFF instead.)
   Multiply by the <tt>pow()</tt> result above and divide by
   65535.  THe result is the per-channel mixing level.

   <li>In the original decoders, this is then further multiplied
   by the <a href="#MasterVolumeLevel">master volume level</a>
   multiplier factor, thus combining the per-channel mixing
   level with the global volume level.  New implementations can
   do the same thing, or can apply the global volume level at
   any later point before sending samples to the DAC.  All
   operations on the decoded samples between decompression and
   DAC output are linear, to volume factors can be applied at
   any time that's convenient.  The best time might depend upon
   the numeric representation being used, since it can affect
   the stored precision if the intermediate calculations are
   performed using integers or fixed-point types.
</ul>

<p>
   During frame decompression, each frequency-domain sample
   decoded from the binary data stream if multiplied by the mixing
   multiplier, and the result is added into the working audio
   buffer.
</p>
<p>
   Note that an aggregate adjustment level of 0 yields a very
   small but non-zero mixing multiplier, about 0.03.  The DCS ROM
   track programs typically set their own cross-channel adjustment
   level to a value in the range $70 to $78 before each track,
   which yields a multiplier in the 0.8 ballpark.  They rarely
   set it higher; the recordings mostly seem to be recorded at
   a reference level where $70 to $78 saturates the reconstruction,
   and higher levels cause clipping and distortion.  If you're
   creating your own original recordings, you'll probably need
   to experiment with mixing levels to find the right setting
   to use for playback.
</p>

<a name="MasterVolumeLevel"></a>
<h3>Master volume level</h3>

<p>
   The master volume level is applied in the final PCM output step,
   after all of the active channels have been decoded into the
   working audio buffer, and the working buffer has been transformed
   from the frequency domain to the time domain.
</p>
<p>
   The 8-bit level set with the $55AA data port command is translated
   into a multiplier factor, using a "power" calculation similar to the
   mixing level adjustment calculation.  The multiplier is calculated
   as <tt>pow(0.981201, 255 - x)</tt>, where <tt>x</tt> is the 8-bit
   level from the $55AA command, treated as an unsigned 8-bit
   integer value in the range 0 to 255.  Each PCM sample from the
   domain transform is multiplied by the <tt>pow()</tt> result to determine the
   final PCM value sent to the audio DAC.  (As usual, the original
   ADSP-2105 implementation calculates the <tt>pow()</tt> formula
   using <a href="#VolumeMultiplierInts">integer arithmetic</a>,
   interpreting the result as a fixed-point fraction.)
</p>

<a name="Channel5VolumeOverrideHack"></a>
<h3>Channel 5 volume override hack</h3>
<p>
   Version 1.05 of the original decoder software has a very odd
   hack that adds one more wrinkle to the mixing level calculation.
   I call this the Channel 5 Volume Override Hack.
</p>
<p>
   This feature has the effect of making Channel 5 (and only that channel)
   act as though the master volume level <i>and</i> the per-channel
   host-controlled volume level were both set to $FF, regardless
   of their actual current settings.  This override is only in effect when a
   special flag is enabled.  The flag is enabled by using track
   program opcode $04 to write byte value $69 to the data port.
   The flag is disabled by writing byte value $6A to the data port,
   or by starting a new audio stream on channel 5.
</p>
<p>
   I included this behavior in my native C++ DCS Decoder implementation, just for
   the sake of 100% bug-for-bug compatibility, but it's of marginal value at best.
   It was only ever triggered by one track each in the five software 1.05
   games, and always the same track ($03DE), which I think is one of
   the stock operator-menu sounds; it probably just got copied into
   each game from a template starter ROM, so it might not even
   actually be used in most of the games where it appears.  Why
   that one track requires the special full-volume playback override
   is unclear, and I doubt very much that a player or operator would
   ever notice the difference.  But even so, someone cared about it enough to
   go to the trouble to add the code, which is non-trivial - it comprises
   four or five related changes scattered through the machine code program.
</p>
<p>
   I call this a "hack" because it's so obviously a quick-and-dirty
   code change that someone added to achieve an ad hoc objective,
   creating a bizarre special case instead of thinking it through
   well enough to find a general-purpose solution to whatever problem
   they were trying to solve.  No one probably even bothered to stop
   to think if the problem itself was worth solving the first place.
   It almost certainly wasn't, given that the hack was only ever used
   for the one sound effect.  At any
   rate, sound designers working with the software now have to be
   aware of the non-sensical side effect of the data port write.
</p>

<a name="SpecialCommands"></a>
<h2>Special command codes</h2>

<p>
   Most of the command codes sent from the WPC host to the DCS board are
   two-byte sequences that load track programs.  The sound board interprets
   each such sequence as a 16-bit number, with the first byte as the high
   8 bits, and looks up the track matching that number in the track index.
   For example, if the WPC board sends the sequence $01 $40, the sound
   board combines the bytes to form the 16-bit number $0140, and looks
   in the track index for track $0140.  If such a track exists, it loads
   the track into its channel and starts it executing.
</p>

<p>
   There are also a few special command codes that the DCS operating
   system software handles directly, without looking for a matching track
   program.  These command sequences are always either two bytes or four
   bytes long.  The first byte is always $55, and the second byte is a
   code $AA to $FF that specifies which special command it is.
</p>

<p>
   For the four-byte commands, the third byte is a parameter, and the
   fourth byte is always the bitwise NOT (all bits inverted) of the third
   byte.  The fourth byte is just there as a sort of checksum to validate
   that the sequence was received correctly.  I guess when the messages
   get up to a whopping three bytes long, there's too much of a chance of
   transmission error in such a rudimentary network setup, so they had
   to add some error detection.   The software simply ignores any four-byte
   command where the check byte doesn't match the expected value.
</p>
<p>
   One more note on command processing: each byte of a command sequence
   must be received on the DCS side within 100ms of the previous byte.
   The DCS software clears any buffered bytes if more than 100ms
   elapses between consecutive bytes.  This implies that a sender can
   wait a little longer than 100ms before sending the first byte of
   a new command if it wants to essentially reset the network connection,
   ensuring that the DCS receiver doesn't
   think it's in the middle of some earlier partially-sent command sequence.
</p>
<p>
   Here are the special command sequences (<b>~x</b> signifies the bitwise NOT of <b>x</b>):
</p>

<ul>

   <li><b>$55 $AA <i>volume</i> ~<i>volume</i>:</b> Sets the master audio volume, 0 to 255,
   mute to maximum.  The volume on the DCS boards is set purely in
   software, by scaling the PCM data going into the DAC.   The volume
   control is figured into the PCM data by multiplying the PCM amplitudes
   by a scaling factor that's derived from the 0 to 255 setting, using a
   log curve that makes the scale sound roughly linear to a human ear.
   At 255, the scaling factor is 1.0, so you get the reference level of
   the recordings; lower volumes attenuate the PCM amplitude along that
   log curve.  The 0-255 scale corresponds very straightforwardly to the
   0-31 scale displayed in the operator menus when you use the volume
   controls inside the coin door, by multiplying the displayed value
   by 8.  When the display shows 31, the software sends 31*8 = 248 ($F8)
   to the DCS board.

   <li><b>$55 $AB-$B0 <i>level</i> ~<i>level</i>:</b> Sets the per-channel mixing level.
   See <a href="#Mixer">Audio Mixer</a>.
   The second byte selects which channel this affects: $AB is channel 0,
   $AC is channel 1, and so forth through $B0 for channel 5.  The level
   is a byte value, 0 to 255, that sets the mixing level for the
   channel corresponding to the second byte value.  The per-channel
   mixing level is combined with the internal mixing levels set by
   the track programs to determine the relative volume of the channel
   in the overall mix-down into the final mono signal, and this is
   then further modified by the global volume level.  So many volume
   adjustments!  In practice, none of the WPC games seem to ever send
   these commands.  This is apparently one of those hidden features
   that the DCS engineers implemented for their own amusement, and
   never got around to mentioning to the game designers.

   <li><b>$55 $C2:</b> Get the DCS software's major version number. 
   The sound board replies by sending one byte to the data port, with
   the byte value set to the DCS software's major version number,
   which is always $01.  (I call
   this the "major" version number in the sense of the common software
   industry convention of writing version numbers as dotted pairs
   of the form "major.minor", as in "1.0" or "2.10".)
   This command is only implemented in DCS-95 games
   starting around 1996; earlier games didn't implement this command at
   all.  Note that this is separate from the "audio data version number"
   that the WPC system displays on the DMD when entering the operator
   menu.  That display reflects the version of the audio content, not
   of the software; some games had more than one version of their audio
   ROMs released, with later versions featuring new or updated
   sound effects.  The operating system
   doesn't know anything about the audio data version; that's handled through a track
   program, so the command code to retrieve it is idiosyncratic
   per game.  See <a href="#DCSOSVersions">DCS Software Versions</a>.

   <li><b>$55 $C3:</b> Get the DCS software's minor version number.
   The sound board replies with one byte to the data
   port containing the minor version number - the part after the
   dot in the "1.03" format.  The reply is $03, $04, or $05, depending
   upon the vintage of the game.  As with $55 $C2 (query the major
   version number), this command is only implemented in DCS titles
   released starting around 1996.  We can infer from the range of
   values observed in the releases that did implement this command that
   the earlier versions that <i>didn't</i> were probably called
   1.00, 1.01, and 1.02 - which would only have been working version
   designations used by the developers, since this command wasn't
   there to announce an official version label.  This speculative
   version history aligns almost perfectly with the number of distinct
   DCS builds found in the various earlier pinball titles - although
   to be truly definitive, we'd probably have to add a notional third
   part to the version number to represent an ad hoc build number,
   because it seems that they at least recompiled the software for
   almost every release, resulting in small differences (probably
   trivial and with no function impact) even among releases with the
   same $55C3 label.  See <a href="#DCSOSVersions">DCS Software Versions</a>.

   <li><b>$55 $BA-$C1 <i>param</i> ~<i>param</i>:</b> Mystery command,
   implemented only in some of the later DCS-95 games, that doesn't do
   anything.  It seems to be either scaffolding for a future
   feature that was never completed, or detritus from a once-planned
   feature that was canceled.  Whatever the story behind it, the
   command appears to have been conceived as doing something akin to
   the $55 $AB series of commands, in that
   it's similarly arrayed across the audio channels, and it seems to have
   similar data structures for something like a volume level and some
   timers.  It also seems to be related to mystery opcodes $10-$12,
   in that those opcodes write to the same data structures as the
   $55BA et seq. command handler.  Despite all of the work that
   evidently went into setting all this up, the data structure
   involved don't actually do anything - there's nothing else in
   the code that ever accesses them.  The only effect the commands
   and opcodes have is to write some bytes to some memory locations
   that are otherwise unused.

</ul>


<h2>Appendices</h2>
<p>
   This section contains additional details, including the pre-defined
   data tables used by the DCS formats for encoding and decoding.
   Where possible, we've provided the tables in the form of C/C++
   statically initialized data structures, since that format can be
   easily copied and pasted into a C project, and is straightforward
   to translate mechanically into almost any other programming language.

<h3>Encoding window function</h3>
<p>
   My prototype encoder uses the following window function, which
   is based on a cosine taper.  This seems to produce good results,
   so if you don't have a reason to create a custom one, you can
   just use this one.  If you'd like to know more about creating
   your own window function, the material below explains how.
</p>

<pre>
    // window function coefficients based on cosine taper
    static const float windowFunctionCoefficients[] ={
        0.010179f, 0.040507f, 0.090368f, 0.158746f, 0.244250f, 0.345139f, 0.459359f, 0.584585f,
        0.647178f, 0.752018f, 0.829799f, 0.888221f, 0.932184f, 0.964581f, 0.986700f, 0.998439f
    };</pre>

<p>
   During the audio encoding process, each frame is modified by a
   "window function" prior to the Fourier transform step.  This
   is a common practice in this sort of audio encoder, because
   a well-chosen window function reduces the artifacts that
   naturally arise when applying a frequency-domain transform
   to a finite time window containing non-periodic data.
   Typically, the window function
   tapers the samples near the edges of the frame (i.e.,
   near the start and end of the time window) towards silence,
   as though fading in at the start of the frame and fading
   out at the end.  This makes the waveform within the frame
   more closely resemble a periodic (repeating) wave, by
   forcing the endpoints to zero.  This in turn yields a better
   reconstruction of the original frame when reversing the
   Fourier transform during decoding.
</p>
<img src="window-func.png" class="ex">

<p>
   We obviously don't want this fade-in and fade-out in
   every frame to be audible.  That's what the
   <a href="#Frames">frame overlap</a> scheme is for.
   If the window function is devised correctly, the overlapping
   portions of the adjacent frames will exactly add up to the
   original signal.  This trick is accomplished by making
   sure that the fade-in at the start of the frame is the
   exact mirror image of the fade-out at the end of the
   previous frame.  The combination of the symmetrical window
   function and the overlap gives us the improved Fourier transform
   results we wanted, but without adding any new fade-in-out
   artifacts to the stream in the process.
</p>
<img src="window-overlap.png" class="ex">

<p>
   In concrete terms, the window function is simply a set of
   coefficients that are multiplied into the frame buffer.
   These are typically chosen in advance and treated as
   constants.  During encoding, the encoder simply multiplies
   each frame sample by the corresponding window function
   coefficient for that position in the frame.
</p>
<p>
   The DCS format doesn't directly define a window function,
   but the reference decoders do <i>constrain</i> the choice of
   window function, because they use a set of fixed constants
   to "undo" the window function when reconstructing the samples.
   The encoder must therefore choose window function coefficients
   that yield encoded samples that decode back to the original
   values when the decoder applies its fixed constants.
</p>
<p>
   The decoder constants constrain the Window function as
   follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Let <i>c</i>[<i>k</i>] be the <i>k</i>th decoder
   mixing coefficient (the pre-defined constants hard-coded into the
   reference decoders), where <i>k</i> ranges from 0 to 15:
   <pre>
   static const float decodingOverlapCoeff[] = {
       0.009644f, 0.056274f, 0.129395f, 0.225952f,
       0.343445f, 0.476776f, 0.616882f, 0.751251f,
       0.866577f, 0.952942f, 1.006805f, 1.031403f,
       1.034271f, 1.024597f, 1.011169f, 1.001465f
   };</pre>

   <li>Let  <i>w</i>[<i>k</i>] be the <i>k</i>th encoder window
   function coefficient, <i>k</i> in 0 to 15.

   <li>Then the <i>w</i>[<i>k</i>] coefficients must satisfy
   this relationship:

   <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block" style="margin: 2em auto;">
      <mi>w</mi>
      <mo stretchy="false">[</mo>

            <mo stretchy="false">]</mo>
         </mrow>
      </mfrac>
   </math>

   <li>In addition, <i>w</i>[<i>k</i>] &lt; <i>w</i>[<i>k</i>+1] should hold for every <i>k</i> &lt; 15.
   This isn't a constraint imposed by the DCS decoders, but rather is a property that a
   good window function should have.

   <li>Finally, 0 &lt; <i>w</i>[<i>k</i>] &lt; 1 should hold for each <i>k</i> (this
   is another property the window function should have that isn't a DCS constraint).
</ul>

<p>
   The constraints essentially say that you can choose any values you like for
   half of the window function coefficients, and the other half are determined
   by the formula.
</p>
<p>
   The original, official DCS encoder undoubtedly used a specific window function,
   and I would even venture that it was probably considered part of the DCS format specification.
   The overlap mixing coefficients in the decoders were undoubtedly chosen based on their
   encoder window function, rather than going in the other direction as we are here.
   But it's impossible to infer what that original window function might have been
   from the decoder alone, since it only constrains the window function coefficients
   to the extent described above.
</p>
<p>
   You can find more information on the theory behind this in
   any in-depth technical discussion of audio encoding, such as
   technical articles about MP3 or Ogg Vorbis internals.

<a name="HuffmanStructs"></a>
<h3>Huffman-type codebooks</h3>
<p>
   Many of the DCS audio streams represent certain fields using
   Huffman-type codes.  A Huffman code represents a collection of plaintext
   values with a varying number of bits in the data stream.  This
   is a form of "entropy coding" that compresses data by representing
   the most frequently used plaintext values with smaller codewords.
   Think of Morse code, with its very short codeword for the letter
   <b>E</b> ("dit") and its long codeword for <b>Q</b> ("dah dah dit dah").
   Or, if you're familiar with the principles that make Zip compression
   work, think of Zip files.
</p>
<p>
   DCS uses many different Huffman-type codes.  Which code is used
   depends entirely on the context.
</p>
<p>
   All of DCS's Huffman-type codings are pre-defined and permanently fixed,
   and shared across all instances of a given format version.  The original
   ADSP-2105 software stores the codebooks as data tables in a separate
   section of the ROM from the program code, which suggests that the
   designers thought they might want to be able to vary the codes from
   game to game, perhaps to optimize each game's tables for the specific
   statistics of that game's audio data.  But this capability was never used.
   All of the codebooks for a given format version are fixed across all of the
   games using the format.  That allows us to treat the codebooks
   simply as fixed features of their respective formats, and thus to list the
   codebooks here.

<p>
   To make the data easier to use in new software projects, the
   codebooks are listed as initialized C-language data structures.
   The tables are defined as arrays of the following C struct type:
</p>
<pre>
    struct HuffmanCodebook {
       uint32_t  plaintext;       // plaintext value
       uint32_t  codeword;        // codeword (bits stored in bit stream)
       int       codewordLength;  // number of bits in codeword
    };</pre>
<p>
   The <b>plaintext</b> field gives the decoded value of the codeword.
   <b>codeword</b> and <b>codewordLength</b> give the encoded value as
   it appears in a bit stream.  The bits of the codeword are stored
   "right-justified" in <b>codeword</b>, meaning that they're stored
   in the least-significant bits of the field.  (The longest codewords
   in all of the DCS codes are 30 bits.)
</p>
<p>
   This struct isn't in the ideal form for use in a decoder, but
   here's an inefficient algorithm that uses it directly: look ahead
   in the bit stream by the maximum codeword length of all elements
   in the codebook, then scan for a matching element where the first
   <b>codewordLength</b> bits of the lookahead match the bits in
   <b>codeword</b>.  You'd want to use a more efficient algorithm
   in a practical implementation, though.  There are several
   well-known efficient algorithms for decoding this sort of code,
   all of which require building some other form of index on the
   codebook for faster lookup.  One approach is to build a binary
   tree that indexes the codewords by leading bit substrings;
   another is to build an array indexed by an N-bit lookahead.
   The full algorithms are beyond our scope here, but they're all
   well-known basic algorithms that should be fairly easy to find
   in a textbook or on the Web.
</p>
<p>
   To use this struct in an encoder, you'd start by looking up the plaintext
   value that you want to encode, then you'd write the corresponding
   <b>codeword</b> to the bit stream under construction, writing the
   number of bits specified in <b>codewordLength</b>.  The struct
   represents the bits to store in the least significant
   bits of <b>codeword</b>.  Bits are always written to the stream <b>most
   significant first</b>.  So if <b>codeword</b> is 0x0003 and <b>codewordLength</b>
   is 4, you'd take the low-order four bits of 0x0003, or '0011', then
   you'd write those four bits to the stream in that order.  In a
   practical implementation, you'd want to create an efficient
   index to look up entries by plaintext value, such as a hash map
   or array index.

<h3>Scaling factor codes</h3>
<p>
   The 1993b and 1994 stream formats use a 6-bit code to represent
   the scaling factors that are applied to bit-stream samples to
   reconstruct the corresponding audio buffer samples.  The scaling
   factors are encoded with two bit fields:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Bits $03 (the low-order two bits) select the "mantissa" of the scaling factor,
   from the following pre-defined values:
   <ul>
      <li>$00 = $8000
      <li>$01 = $9838
      <li>$02 = $B505
      <li>$03 = $D745
   </ul>

   <li>Bits $3C (the next higher four bits) specify the right shift; interpret the
   4-bit value as unsigned integer, then subtract it from 15 to get the right shift

   <li>Apply the right shift to the mantissa to get the final scaling factor,
   which is expressed as a fixed-point fraction with 16 bits after the binary point
</ul>
<p>
   In C code, the scaling factor for a given scaling code can be computed as follows:
</p>
<pre>
   static const uint16_t mantissas[] = { 0x8000, 0x9838, 0xb505, 0xd745 };
   uint16_t mantissa = mantissas[code &amp; 0x0003];
   uint16_t shift = 0x000F - ((code &gt;&gt; 2) &amp; 0x000F);
   uint16_t scalingFactor = mantissa &gt;&gt; shift;</pre>

<p>
   The result is interpreted as a fixed-point fraction with 16
   bits after the binary point.  The numerical value is
   the uint16_t value divided by 65536; in C, <tt>((float)scalingFactor)/65536.0f</tt>.
   Or, to use the value in purely integer arithmetic (as the original
   ADSP-2105 decoder implementation does), use 32-bit variables to
   multiply the scaling factor by a sample value, then take the
   high-order 16-bits of the result:
</p>
<pre>
   int16_t scaledSample = (int16_t)(((int32_t)inputSample * scalingFactor) &gt;&gt; 16);</pre>

<p>
   The <a href="#1994Type01">1994 Type 1 format</a> applies
   an adjustment to the scaling factor code specified in the stream
   header in every frame and every band, <i>before</i> translating
   the code into a multiplier.  This doesn't change the calculation
   above; it's just an adjustment to the code value used in
   the calculation.  The adjustment is a value taken from
   a lookup table based on the Band Type Code for the current band
   in the current frame, and then added to the base scaling factor
   code from the stream header.  See the discussion of the
   <a href="#1994Type01">1994 Type 1 format</a> for more details.
</p>

<p>
   Here's a C array with pre-computed values for all of the possible
   scaling factor codes, which is also helpful to visualize how the
   codes map to concrete multiplier values.  The array is indexed by
   scaling factor code.

<h3>1993b Type 1 Band Type codebook</h3>
<p>
   This codebook is used for the Band Type Code that appears in each
   band of a <a href="#1993bType01">1993b Type 1</a> stream. 
   This is a Huffman-type varying bit length code; see
   <a href="#HuffmanStructs">Huffman-type codebooks</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The codebook below is presented using a custom struct instead of our
   usual HuffmanCodebook struct, because this code associates two separate
   plaintext values with each codeword: the delta value for the Band Type
   Code (the difference between the new band's code and the code for the
   corresponding band in the prior frame), and a separate bit flag indicating
   whether or not the Band Sub-Type code is flipped from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.
   As a result, we need an additional boolean field for the "flip" value.
   (There are more compact ways to represent this, such as OR'ing an additional
   bit into the delta value when "flip" is true, or adding a large offset
   to the delta value when "flip" is true; but those come at the expense
   of clarity, so they're more suited for implementation than documentation.)

   The samples in a <a href="#1994Type01">1994-format</a> frame are encoded
   with different codings that depend upon the Band Type code of the
   band containing the samples.
   Samples in bands with Band Type codes 1-6 are encoded with Huffman-type varying-bit-length
   codes.  Each Band Type code 1-6 uses a different codebook, as listed below.

<h3>Selected calculations using ADSP-2105 equivalent arithmetic</h3>
<p>
   The original DCS decoder implementations were built for the
   Analog Devices ADSP-2105, a special-purpose CPU designed for
   DSP applications.  That processor doesn't have have native
   floating-point registers or instructions, so the decoders did
   most of their calculations with fixed-point arithmetic, which
   represents fractional values using integer machine registers.
   Most basic arithmetic on fixed-point fractions can be
   implemented using the corresponding integer operations.
</p>
<p>
   Most of the DCS encoder/decoder algorithms are based on
   mathematical formulations that aren't tied to specific
   hardware numeric types, so this document mostly defines the
   algorithms in terms of the math rather than the ADSP-2105
   implementation.  However, doing the same math with different
   numeric formats will often yield slightly different results,
   due to differences in stored precision and rounding losses.
   For reference, some of the key integer calculations from
   the original decoders are provided below.

<h4>Channel mixing level multiplier</h3>
<p>
   See <a href="#MixingMultiplier">Mixing Multiplier Factor</a>.  In the
   calculation below, <tt>multiplier</tt> is the per-channel mixing level
   set via the $55 $AB series of <a href="#SpecialCommands">special commands</a>,
   shifted left by 7 bits, or the constant value 0x7FFF for two early 1993
   games that didn't have that command (<i>Indiana Jones</i> and <i>Judge Dredd</i>).
   I don't think any WPC games ever use the $55 $AB commands, so the initial
   multiplier value is probably always 0x7F00, except in those two early games
   where it's hard-coded as 0x7FFF.  <tt>mixingLevel</tt> is the 8-bit result
   of combining all of the channel-to-channel mixing levels, as described
   in <a href="#MixingMultiplier">Mixing Multiplier Factor</a> - it's the
   value <tt>x</tt> used in the <tt>pow()</tt> formula there.
   The result, <tt>channelMixingMultiplier</tt>, is the per-channel multiplier
   used in the decoder to multiply decoded samples before adding them into the
   working audio buffer.

<h4>Master volume scaling factor</h3>
<p>
   See <a href="#MasterVolumeLevel">Master Volume Level</a>.
   <tt>vol</tt> is the 8-bit master volume level set via the
   $55 $AA <a href="#SpecialCommands">special command</a>,
   from 0 (mute) to 255 (maximum volume).  The result
   value <tt>volumeMultiplier</tt> is the multiplication
   factor the decoder applies to PCM samples as they're
   copied into the DAC output buffer.  When <tt>vol</tt>
   is zero, skip this calculation and simply
   set the <tt>volumeMultiplier</tt> to 0.

<h4>Volume Scaling Exponent</h4>
<p>
   The original decoders use a hybrid form of floating-point
   arithmetic for the intermediate calculations during decoding.
   Normally, "floating-point" means something like C's <b>double</b>
   type, where each number is stored with a mantissa and scaling
   exponent, allowing each variable to use the entire available
   range of the type.  The ADSP-2105 CPU, where the original
   decoders run, doesn't have native floating-point types, so
   any floating-point arithmetic on that platform has to be done
   explicitly in software, by storing the mantissa and scaling
   exponent for a given value in separate variables.  The
   decoders take this approach for storing intermediate
   values throughout the decoding process.  Rather than
   storing a separate scaling exponent for each individual
   value, however, the decoders pre-compute a common scaling
   exponent that's implicitly used for all samples throughout the
   entire decoding process.  This reduces memory usage
   compared to storing a scale exponent separately for each
   value, which is important given the ADSP-2105's small RAM
   space.  It also simplifies the arithmetic (and thereby
   improves run-time speed) compared to true
   floating-point math, since most arithmetic operations can
   be performed as though the operands were integers when
   the operands share a common scaling exponent.
</p>
<p>
   The common scaling exponent used through the decoding process
   is calculated at the start of each main loop iteration, just
   before decoding frames for that cycle.  The scale is calculated
   based on the <a href="#MasterVolumeLevel">global volume level</a>
   and the sum of the <a href="#MixingMultiplier">Mixing Multiplier Factor</a>,
   since that determines the largest sample value that can be obtained
   during frame decompression.  The scale is chosen such that the
   largest possible scaled sample value, after multiplying by the
   volume factors, will just fill the 16-bit registers used for
   the intermediate calculations, without overflowing.  This
   maximizes the precision retained through the intermediate
   calculations.
</p>
<p>
   Once the scale is determined, the
   mixing multiplier factor for each channel is adjusted to this
   scale.  Since that's used to multiply each sample decoded from
   the bit stream, the same scale automatically propagates to the
   samples.  The scale is thus implicit in all of the intermediate
   calculations.  (Saying that the scale is "implicit" means that
   it's not separately stored with each value.  It's just hidden
   in the structure of the code.)
   The scale only becomes explicit again at the last step,
   when the fully decoded samples are converted to INT16 values for
   output to the DAC, at which point the samples are shifted by the
   scaling exponent to convert them to integers.
</p>
<p>
   The C++ code below illustrates in portable terms how the ADSP-2105
   decoders calculate the scaling factor.  The code depends upon the
   following external variables that aren't explicitly declared:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>mixingMultipler</b> is the per-channel <a href="#MixingLevelMultiplierInts">mixing level multiplier</a>,
   calculated using ADSP-2105-equivalent integer arithmetic
   
   <li><b>volumeMultiplioer</b> is the <a href="#VolumeMultiplierInts">master volume scaling factor</a>,
   as calculated using ADSP-2105-equivalent integer arithmetic

   <li><b>channel[]</b> is an array of MAX_CHANNELS struct elements containing information
   about the DCS playback channels, where MAX_CHANNELS is the number of channels in the
   source material's software version (4 channels for the 1993 software, 6 channels for
   the later version)
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
   To pre-calculate the common scaling exponent to use during the decoding process:
</p>
<pre>
    // calculate the sum of the mixing levels * volume level, in 5.30 fixed-point format
    uint64_t mixingSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; MAX_CHANNELS ; ++i)
    {
        if (channel[i].HasActiveAudio())
            mixingSum += static_cast&lt;uint64_t&gt;(channel[i].mixingMultiplier) * volumeMultiplier;
    }

    // adjust to 4.28 format
    mixingSum &gt;&gt;= 2;

    // Calculate the scale, add 3 to adjust from 4.28 to 1.31 format.  Limit
    // the result to range 0 to 8, to ensure we have at least 8 bits of precision
    // in the intermediate values.
    int volShift = -CalcScalingExponent(mixingSum) + 3;
    volShift = volShift &lt; 0 ? 0 : volShift &gt; 8 ? 8 : volShift;

    // re-scale the mixing multipliers to the new scale
    for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; MAX_CHANNELS ; ++i)
    {
        uint64_t m = (static_cast&lt;uint64_t&gt;(channel[i].mixingMultiplier)
                      * volumeMultiplier) &lt;&lt; 1;
        channel[i].mixingMultiplier = static_cast&lt;uint16_t&gt;((m &lt;&lt; volShift) &gt;&gt; 16);
    }</pre>

<p>
   The code above calls upon this helper subroutine to figure the bit-shift
   amount used for the scaling exponent, given the upper bound on sample sums:
</p>
<pre>
    int CalcScalingExponent(uint32_t x)
    {
        int res = 0;
        if ((x & 0x80000000) != 0)
        {
            for ( ; (x &amp; 0x40000000) != 0 ; --res, x &lt;&lt;= 1) ;
        }
        else
        {
            for ( ; res > -31 &amp;&amp; (x &amp; 0x40000000) == 0 ; --res, x &lt;&lt;= 1) ;
        }
        return res;
    }</pre>

<p>
    To apply the scale to the final PCM samples before sending them to the DAC:
</p>
<pre>
    sample = static_cast&lt;int16_t&gt;(
        static_cast&lt;int32_t&gt;(static_cast&lt;int16_t&gt;(sample)) &gt;&gt; volShift);</pre>

<p>
   (That complex series of casts isn't just being pedantic, or mindlessly
   trying to shut up compiler warnings.  It's actually necessary for
   portability, and all of the casts must be performed in the order
   shown.  The casts are carefully constructed to preserve the
   sign for negative values.  The C and C++ standards don't
   provide portable definitions for right shifts of negative values, so
   we have to promote the value to a wider integer type, preserving
   the sign in the process, before performing the shift.  This ensures
   that the result is calculated the same way the ADSP-2105 would have
   done it, no matter how the local platform defines the right-shift
   of a negative operand.)

<h4>Frame decoding overlap coefficients</h4>
<p>
   See <a href="#Frames">Frames</a>.  The ADSP-2105 decoders
   use the following integers for the frame overlap mixing
   calculation.  These are interpreted as <b>unsigned 0.16</b>
   fixed-point fractions: to recover the mathematical value,
   take the nominal binary integer, treating it as unsigned,
   and divide by 65536.

<h3>DCS Software Versions</h3>

<p>
   The DCS firmware (which I sometimes call the "DCS OS", for Operating
   System) was revised several times over the DCS pinball years.  The
   pinball machine DMD menus never display a version number for the OS
   software as far as I've seen, but the Williams engineers apparently
   did assign version labels internally.  At least, that's my inference,
   arising mostly from a command that was added to the cross-board
   communications protocol in a 1996 release.  The new command's
   only function is to send back a byte pair to the host, which
   is always one of $01 $03, $01 $04,
   or $01 $05, with later release dates correlating with a higher
   value for the second byte.  To my eye, these are very obviously
   meant to represent versions 1.03, 1.04, and 1.05, respectively.
   (The "new command" I'm talking about is actually two commands,
   $55 $C2 and $55 $C3.  See <a href="#SpecialCommands">Special
   command codes</a>.)
</p>
<p>
   If this really is a version number, what happened to the versions
   before 1.03?  Remember that this command was only added in the 1996
   software, so it actually makes sense that it would start somewhere
   other than 1.0, since there were earlier releases going back to
   1993.  A straightforward explanation is that the Williams
   engineers had been assigning version numbers all along, probably
   starting at 1.00 for the first 1993 release, and then incremented
   a couple of times for releases in 1994 and 1995.  When they
   added the new command, they simply had it report the version
   that they had been using internally.  Further, a version
   number of 1.03 for the 1996 release aligns well with an assumption
   that the original 1993 software was labeled 1.00, because we
   can identify just about three functionally distinct versions
   when we look at the games released from 1993 to 1996 - implying
   releases that were internally labeled 1.00, 1.01, and 1.02.
   There wasn't anything embedded in the firmware in these versions
   to suggest which of these early version labels goes with which game,
   but we can make educated guesses by working backwards along the
   pinball game release timeline and looking for functional changes
   in the firmware substantial enough to warrant a version
   number bump.  Obviously, the last of the games that lacked the
   version-query command should be labeled 1.02, and we can decide
   where to draw the line for 1.01 and 1.00 according to how
   different the firmware is in each earlier game.  The list of pinball
   titles below shows the version numbers that I came up with by
   applying this procedure.
</p>
<p>
   There is one hiccup in the pre-1.03 timeline that I should mention.
   There are actually <i>four</i> functionally distinguishable
   versions of the firmware between 1993 and 1996, but we only have
   three version labels available (1.00, 1.01, 1.02) if we assume that
   the first release was internally labeled 1.00.  This implies one of
   two things.  One possibility is that the first version was actually
   labeled something like "0.9", which is common practice, especially
   among open-source developers, to label versions that are approaching
   a first release but aren't quite there yet.  The other possibility,
   which I consider more likely given the era, is that the engineers
   didn't follow a rigorously formalized release process, and assigning
   version labels was something of an afterthought that was done
   informally and perhaps even a little haphazardly.  Even in the
   later releases that do contain formal version stamps embedded in
   the software (via the $55 $C2/$C3 commands), we can see slightly
   different builds that were released under the same nominal version
   number, which suggests that the engineers never observed a truly
   formal release process.
</p>
<p>
   Anyway, my solution to the problem of assigning three labels to
   four functional releases is to split the 1.00 label into two
   sub-releases, 1.0a and 1.0b.  I chose this approach because the
   first three games released in 1993 (<i>Judge Dredd</i>, <i>Indiana
   Jones: The Pinball Adventure</i>, and <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>)
   clearly constituted two variants of an early version, and
   everything that followed had very different software.
   It might be even better to call those two early releases 0.91 and 0.92;
   the overhaul that followed was so massive that it makes me think that
   the engineers might have considered these early versions to be more
   prototypes than real finished products.  But those versions were in
   fact sold to paying customers, which makes them production releases,
   and it seems like poor form to ship production software under a
   zero-dot label.

<h2>References</h2>
<p>
   As far as I'm aware, there are no other public sources of information
   about DCS format internals.  That's one of the reasons I got started on
   this project, actually.  Here are the main other references to DCS
   I've been able to find:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/vpinball/pinmame" target="_blank">PinMame</a>, an
   open-source emulator for nearly all solid-state pinball machine
   controllers.  PinMame includes emulation for the DCS hardware,
   which runs the original DCS ROMs and thus can play back their audio.
   PinMame's approach to emulation is to provide a virtual hardware
   environment that directly runs the original ROM software unchanged,
   so PinMame doesn't need to know anything about how the software
   works internally.  PinMame is a good resource for details about
   the DCS hardware platform, but won't tell you anything about the
   software or the audio data format.

   <li><a href="https://www.edcheung.com/album/album07/Pinball/wpc_sound.htm">WPC DCS Sound and CPU FPGA Project,</a>
   by Ed Cheung, is probably the deepest and most comprehensive analysis of the
   DCS hardware you're likely to find on the web.  The project involved creating
   an FPGA that simulates the original Williams-designed custom chips on the DCS boards
   (known as ASICs, for Application-Specific ICs, and PALs, for Programmable Array Logic chips).
   Those chips implement a lot of the physical wiring and gate logic that makes the
   DCS boards function at the hardware level, and they're completely undocumented,
   so Ed's FPGA project required extensive black-box reverse-engineering of the
   ASIC and PALs to reconstruct their internal logic.  The project page has a lot
   of information about how the custom chips work that's extremely useful if you're
   repairing DCS boards or trying to create replicas.

   <li>The <b>WPC Schematic Manual</b> is one of the original service manuals that Williams
   published and shipped with the games.  This manual included full schematics of the
   DCS boards, although it's only meant to be used as a repair guide, so it doesn't
